        "description":"I chose a shiny moir\u00e9 fabric in a mauve color. The shine of the material relates to the glazed sugar on the dessert, and the patterned weave adds an element of sharpness and contrast to the softly cushioned fabric. The sugary treat seems to have \"weight\" because it sits in a gently indented space that looks somewhat flesh-like.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called \"Forbidden Pleasures\"--occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements. Callis has said that these soft, sweet, colorful pastries, each lit and staged on a fabric of complimentary texture and design, is about the \"idea that desserts and eating desserts carries some of the same psychological baggage as guilt.\" In other words, eating rich desserts in this health-conscious time can be considered a crime of sorts. In these images, there is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to human sexuality. The seductive ingredients of the pastries and their fabric environments simulate the look of flesh. Although the motivation for this project may have been an impulsive urge to have fun with both the glossy Cibachrome medium and the subject of sweets, Callis was no doubt drawing on the tradition of abundance found in earlier still life painting and the extravagant color of more recent painters representing popular culture.",

Using an 8 x 10-inch camera mounted on a tripod, Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao made numerous exposures over the course of several hours, adjusting it to expand his angle of vision or capture the changing light. After scanning his color negatives, Liao used digital editing software to stitch together a large-scale image that presents broad sweeps of information in minute detail. The resulting inkjet print is a complex, composite image that encapsulates the elements of time and movement.Since moving to New York in 1999, Liao has lived along the number 7 subway line, which connects Main Street in Flushing, Queens, to Times Square in Manhattan. Likening the train's path to the rivers around which ancient civilizations developed and flourished, Liao selected specific locations as both the subject and vantage point for his Habitat 7 series. The series \"transports\" viewers from Flushing to the east and moving westward through the neighborhoods of Corona Park, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Sunnyside before arriving in Manhattan. Each image creates a seamless whole, as does Liao's portrayal of the culturally and economically diverse communities that coexist harmoniously along the eight and a half miles of the train, sometimes referred to as the \"International Express.\"",

Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C. A quieter scene decorates the interior of the cup, with a young man offering a flower to a standing woman holding a mirror.",

As Saint Paul gazes down, the light touches his broad forehead, nose, and ear, showing his furrowed brow, gaunt cheeks, and thinning hair with forceful naturalism. His beard and mustache seem to absorb the light, obscuring his deeply shadowed mouth, neck, and shoulders. Set against a darkened background, the saint's head seems to rise out of the gloom.

An abstract mound at the right represents a clump of trees; a white fence runs diagonally in front. The vaguely defined shape on the fence may be a shadow of two lovers, a recurring theme in Munch's work. He used an undulating line to depict the shoreline that continues into the trees at the right.

In the presence of the Paris-Lyons and Mediterannean Railroad's new viaduct, the ghost images are dwarfed and almost indistinguishable. The railroad, traveling at three times the speed of a horse and carriage, was a unifying element in France, literally and figuratively bridging the country's various regions and promoting an unprecedented sense of nationhood.Like other photographers working in the 1800s, \u00c9douard Baldus used long exposure times to make his photographs. If an individual or a carriage moved away from its initial position, a faint impression was captured on the negative and appeared in the print. The impression's transparency gives it its name, a ghost image. While Baldus made this exposure, the horse and carriage repeatedly moved, twice stopping long enough to be faintly recorded on the negative.",

It charged me up.--Walker EvansThe impact of seeing this striking image for the first time is evident in Walker Evans's vivid recollection. At the time, most photographers were choosing \"pretty\" subjects and creating fanciful atmospheric effects in the style of theImpressionists. Paul Strand's unconventional subject and direct approach challenged assumptions about the medium.At once depicting misery and endurance, struggle and degradation, Strand's portrait of a blind woman sets up a complex confrontation. \"The whole concept of blindness,\" as one historian has noted, \"is aimed like a weapon at those whose privilege of sight permits them to experience the picture. . . .\"",

Scholars believe that this drawing was made around 1522 because it contains the coat of arms of Pope Adrian VI, who only led the Church for a year, from 1522 and 1523.

While this image focuses on the bandaged, bloodied African-American soldier in the center, diagonally positioned limbs of men on the left side of the image direct attention to a mud-covered soldier lying injured on the ground.Photojournalist Larry Burrows framed this image in a manner that emphasizes an apocalyptic, scorched earth in the colors of brown and muted cyan. But there is a hint of vividness in the bright white, bloodstained bandage of a soldier centered in the picture. Prior to Vietnam, war images were typically made using black and white film, so Burrows use of color enhances the impact of this scene.More than any other war until then, the Vietnam conflict was brought to American citizens through the eyes of photojournalists. Their poignant and arresting imagery in magazines likeLifeandLook,television, and newspapers gave Americans an unromantic vision of daily warfare.

The prostitute's deep absorption in her card game contrasts sharply with the soldier's furtive glance. Does he gaze at her cards or down the back or the front of her loose dress? With careless strokes, Edgar Degas quickly defined the woman's fleshy body and the man's broad form. Fascinated by the numerous gestures that reveal social class and sentiment, Degas focused his art on situations that only genre painters had fully used before, such as the class tensions between a man and a woman or the undercurrent of violence and domination in an affair.Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year, Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the \u00c9cole Militaire.

Using an 8 x 10-inch camera mounted on a tripod, Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao made numerous exposures over the course of several hours, adjusting it to expand his angle of vision or capture the changing light. After scanning his color negatives, Liao used digital editing software to stitch together a large-scale image that presents broad sweeps of information in minute detail. The resulting inkjet print is a complex, composite image that encapsulates the elements of time and movement.Since moving to New York in 1999, Liao has lived along the number 7 subway line, which connects Main Street in Flushing, Queens, to Times Square in Manhattan. Likening the train's path to the rivers around which ancient civilizations developed and flourished, Liao selected specific locations as both the subject and vantage point for his Habitat 7 series. The series \"transports\" viewers from Flushing to the east and moving westward through the neighborhoods of Corona Park, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Sunnyside before arriving in Manhattan. Each image creates a seamless whole, as does Liao's portrayal of the culturally and economically diverse communities that coexist harmoniously along the eight and a half miles of the train, sometimes referred to as the \"International Express.\"",

Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck.

The Paris catacombs were former underground quarries that were refitted to house skeletons. Nadar ventured into them to create an unprecedented series of photographs illuminated by flashlight. He used a magnesium lamp, visible in the lower right corner of the image.Six or seven million skeletons were interred in the catacombs; in this photograph, seemingly every one is accounted for. Only sixteen carefully stacked protruding skulls on the wall are clearly distinguishable at left, yet they are all that is needed to indicate what the blackened squares in the distance represent.Around the time that Nadar made this series of a hundred photographs in the catacombs, two of his beloved friends passed away. The photographer may have been exploring his own mortality when he embarked upon this series, but it was also a fashionable pursuit to descend into these macabre depths. In mid-nineteenth century Paris, there were four annual visiting days for the catacombs, at which time they were filled with curious onlookers.",

Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other.

To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.",

A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio.

One of those artists, Agnolo Bronzino, made this drawing as a study of the right hand of one of those sculptures. With precision he copied the crisscross pattern of the accentuated veins and even the square thumbnail.In order to make this study, Bronzino must somehow have raised himself to the level of the hand, since it is drawn straight on and close-up and not from a low viewpoint. Perhaps he used steps to gain a better view or made the study from a cast of the hand. He combined more than one view of the three-dimensional hand, including both the upper surface of the thumb and the bulging muscle along the lower contour of the hand, which in reality cannot be seen at the same time. This gave difficulties when he tried to foreshorten the crooked forefinger, and faint traces of an early attempt still remain.In contrast to the careful presentation on the recto, the draftsman swiftly and spontaneously sketched four heads on the verso of this sheet.",

Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left \"hand\" grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects.

Biographer Giorgio Vasari explained that when Taddeo returned to Rome, his cousin Francesco il Sant'Angelo sought him out and they began to work together on many commissions. Francesco recommended him to a Roman nobleman, Jacopo Mattei, and suggested that Taddeo paint the first two subjects to prove his artistic talent when Mattei thought the artist too young. Taddeo sits precariously on a scaffolding painting the facade, with two allegories of Fame flying above. The Three Graces stand around him with Allegories of Spirit and Pride. Although the frescoes are still unfinished in the drawing, the most famous painters in Rome already flock to see them. Michelangelo arrives on horseback with his servant and two of his followers, and Vasari is deep in conversation with Francesco Salviati on the far right. Completed in 1548, the facade was hailed as a masterpiece by the leading artists in Rome, and it cemented the young Taddeo's reputation.",

This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects.

Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike.

Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye.

The prodigal son takes leave of his father, lavishes his money on worldly pleasures at a brothel, gets chased away by prostitutes, lands in a pigsty, and finally reconciles with his father. In the 1500s, this popular parable taught about the sin of extravagance and the virtue of forgiveness. In contrast to the text of the Bible, which emphasizes the father's final act of forgiveness, artists and patrons of that period often focused lively attention on the brothel scene. Coecke set it further forward than the rest of the action, with the detailed landscape and architectural passages of the other episodes forming an elaborate backdrop. Emphasizing attractive outlines, he filled the entire drawing with elegantly proportioned figures. Scholars believe that the drawing's large scale and horizontal format suggest that Coecke might have made it as a tapestry design.",

I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive \"printings,\" Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of \"the fall of man\" enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.",

He positioned the camera in such a way that the flowers embroidered on the curtain appear to be sprouting from the pots sitting on the window's ledge.The reflection of the photographer's camera is seen in the lower right hand corner-a dark shape with rounded corners and a tripod leg that appears to jut from the plant container on the far right.The scene is easily recognizable, but it takes a moment to understand the relationship between the various parts.

Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673.

By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support. The combination of red, white, and black chalk is a technique known by French term coined in the 1700s,aux trois crayons.On the verso, Corneille drew theMadonna and Child with Saint John Seated in a Landscapein pen and ink, suggesting tonal areas with brownwashand black chalk.

Rather than drawing from life, he used a variety of costume engravings.Ligozzi seems to have invented the idea of showing animals alongside the costumed figures. Throughout his book, the animals often act as commentaries on the figures or reflect physiognomic similarities; here, heads turned to the right and the finely drawn human and feline whiskers link the azappo and the cheetah.Ligozzi's patron, Francesco I de'Medici, probably commissioned the series. During the late 1500s, wealthypatronsinterested in science and exploration often hired artists to paint elaborate, colored illustrations offlora, fauna, and the peoples of foreign lands.",

Mary, the mother of Christ, cradles his head and looks heavenward for divine intercession.TheEntombmentwas meant to make the viewer's religious experience personal and encourage the faithful to imagine the physical horror of Christ's Crucifixion. Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist.

The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the body's essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one.",

Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer. The solid weight of the figures and the frame contrasts with the delicacy of the fine sprays of leaves and flowers extending from the frame.",

The infant Saint John the Baptist and two angels join the Holy Family on an interlude in their flight into Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of Jewish male newborns. To the right, a lightly drawn donkey grazes; the angels are barely discernible at the top left. The focus of attention, however, is the central group of the Virgin and the two children.Michelangelo achieved a solid, sculptural effect by using a combination of different media drawn on top of each other: underdrawing with a stylus, black and then red chalk, followed by pen and brown ink. Finely modulated hatching and cross-hatching enhances the figures' sense of three-dimensionality. Changes reflecting Michelangelo's creative working methods are visible in the head of the Virgin, which is positioned simultaneously looking downwards to the left and upwards to the right.",

Before his sitting, de Pr\u00e9maray wrote to Nadar for advice on the most appropriate clothing for the photograph, suggesting the importance Nadar placed on apparel in his portraits. Whether de Pr\u00e9maray's velvet smock belonged to him or to Nadar is uncertain, but it seems large for the writer's frail figure and the sleeves appear to have been turned back at the wrists, creating deep satin cuffs.On the back of his photographs, Nadar customarily wrote the professions of his sitters; he designated de Pr\u00e9maray as a theatrical critic rather than as the playwright he also was. The deep circles under de Pr\u00e9mary's eyes may be symptoms of the severe illness that soon necessitated a three-year course of hydrotherapeutic treatments. By 1859 the critic's precarious health had forced him to give up all kinds of writing, and he died nine years later at age forty-nine.",

After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property. The ring in which this scaraboid is set is modern. As small, personal items, gems were easy to carry; although this example was made in the Cyclades, it was found in Sicily.",

In contrast to the high degree of finish in his rendering of the head, Klimt treated the sitter's clothing and the back of the chair in a looser, more summary manner, highlighting the palpable emotional connection between sitter and artist.The young woman bears a noticeable resemblance to Sonja Knips, a Viennese socialite whose portrait Klimt painted during the same period. Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession.

He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head.

While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor with his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam observes the scene closely from a doorway on the right.Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas drew the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the \u00c9cole Militaire.

        "description":"The maiden Europa rests atop a white bull, unaware it is the god Jupiter in disguise. According to the tale in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, soon the animal will abduct her across the waves. Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow. The romance is punctuated by long shadows coming in from the left, distinctive of his favorite afternoon light, which help frame the drama at center stage.",

Herschel was not only a preeminent astronomer but also made several significant discoveries in photographic processes, most notably the invention of thecyanotypeblueprint.Even before she began to make photographs, Cameron kept apprised of discoveries in photography through her correspondence with Herschel. In this portrait of her dear friend, Cameron sought to portray \"faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man.\" Cameron draped Herschel in a swath of dark cloth, which served to highlight his white hair and to focus attention on his face.

Although the strong horizontal line of the architecture forms the focus of the drawing as it divides earth from sky, Canaletto also filled the scene with many intricate details. A huntsman walks across the courtyard, dressed in a long frock coat and three-cornered hat, his rifle slung over one shoulder and his dog trotting beside him. A couple stand conversing against the back wall, while another woman in a full skirt and white apron enjoys the sunshine underneath the tower on the right. The rooftops of the city below can be glimpsed through the arched gateway of the central gate.

Shown in a gesture of modesty as if suddenly surprised, she appears in a classic pose known as the \"chaste Venus\" or Medici Venus after a famous life-size Hellenistic marble. Her eyes are slightly textured giving them the appearance of depth.The artist's name is inscribed in Latin on the plinth, or supporting base, of the sculpture. TheVenus--along with Cipriani'sDancing Faun--was created for display at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, the seat or country house of the patron for these works. After casting, the artist destroyed the original plasters to prevent a second use, making the works even more extraordinary. Whereas many such sculptures were displayed unprotected outdoors in gardens, these were not. The condition of the bronze has therefore retained much of the freshness of its original appearance, without staining or pitting of the surface.Cipriani'sVenusis based on a Hellenistic statue that has been on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since the second half of the 1600's. Such copies of Greco-Roman statuary were popular among contemporary wealthy art collectors who wanted their own versions of ancient art seen during their travels in Europe and Greece on what was known as the \"grand tour.\" This particular sculpture, however, takes the \"souvenir\" type to the extreme, as it is a large, full-scale work, difficult to transport, and of such high artistic quality.In the marble version, the work features a support to Venus' leg in the form of a putto riding a dolphin. Cipriani eliminates this element, whose stability is not required in the bronze medium. Some scholars see his choice as possibly inspired by the notion that the ancient marbles were actually copies of lost bronze originals.",

It speaks of abundance, with the huge whipped-cream filling that swirls around the center of each puff.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called \"Forbidden Pleasures\"--occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements. Callis has said that these soft, sweet, colorful pastries, each lit and staged on a fabric of complimentary texture and design, is about the \"idea that desserts and eating desserts carries some of the same psychological baggage as guilt.\" In other words, eating rich desserts in this health-conscious time can be considered a crime of sorts. In these images, there is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to human sexuality. The seductive ingredients of the pastries and their fabric environments simulate the look of flesh. Although the motivation for this project may have been an impulsive urge to have fun with both the glossy Cibachrome medium and the subject of sweets, Callis was no doubt drawing on the tradition of abundance found in earlier still life painting and the extravagant color of more recent painters representing popular culture.",

Hercules killed the king in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them. Gustave Moreau's fascination with violent, emotionally charged subjects portrayed in jewel-like colors typifies mid-1800s French painting. Here Moreau's luminous and delicately applied watercolor washes enhance an already dramatic scene, highlighting the vertical body of the doomed Diomedes, whose extended, stretched limbs repeat the dynamic rearing motion of the brown horse's front legs.

Wealthy tourists and their servants laden with goods contrast with the poor Roman natives who have nothing, such as the woman who lies against the Arch or the man with a cane at the right.

For example, he redrew Lepic's left shoe several times as he experimented to find the correct angle. In contrast, Lepic's face was hastily but assuredly drawn and needed no corrections.

With its strainer spout, this jar would have been used for wine or any other liquid that might contain particles needing filtering.Most decoration on Mycenaean pottery consisted of extremely stylizedmotifsof marine or floral origin. Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus.

Raymond Henri de Staal de Magnoncourt, elder son of the Comte de Magnoncourt, was about sixteen years old when this drawing was made and dedicated to his mother in the bottom corner. His dreamy expression, rumpled yet elegant clothes, tousled hair, and the overall ambiance of artistic beauty and inspiration vividly capture the essence of the Romantic period.Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau brought a sense of poetry and emotion to his portraiture. He used delicate, almost imperceptible lines to create the sitter's face and hands. Soft shading shapes the boy's round cheek, squashed up under his eye as he rests his head on his hand. In contrast, Chass\u00e9riau drew the boy's clothing with dark, strong lines, clearly emphasizing the precise, elegant hatching that creates the fabric's shadows and folds.",

Dr. John Murray, who made this negative while working in India, altered it to improve the visual harmony and luminosity of the finished print. He achieved increased contrast by blocking out the sky area withpigmentand bleaching the deeply shaded section under the roof to more clearly show the mosque interior.The waxed-paper process was particularly useful for traveling photographers like Murray because the paper did not require immediate development. It also offered more translucency than other commonly used negatives. The process involved rubbing wax into the paper negative before it was sensitized and exposed. The wax created a smooth surface and reduced the blurring effects of paper fibers. Both the negative and the final print display great clarity of detail, as in the piercings of the surrounding wall and the outlines of distant buildings.",

In addition to the sixteen scenes from Taddeo's life, the series includes four drawings of allegorical Virtues flanking the Zuccaro emblem. The drawings vividly convey a sense of the artist's material and intellectual life in Renaissance Rome. Details of studio practice join depictions of precise locations, monuments, and antiquities and references to the great artistic personalities of the Renaissance, including Michelangelo and Raphael. Scholars believe that the shape of the drawings shows that they were studies for decorative ceiling panels. Because so many of the sheets contain images of Rome, they may have been intended for frescoes in the Palazzo Zuccari in Rome. In Federico's will of 1603, he left his palazzo to the Accademia di San Luca so that it could be used as a hostel for poor, young artists coming to study in the capital. The imagery of Taddeo's early struggles would have been an appropriate reminder for the students at the beginning of their careers.",

In contrast to the sculptural clarity of the Trinity, the golden angels' heads in the background are painted in such a manner that they are partially formed out of the expanse of blue and red space, making them spatially ambiguous and ethereal. The Trinity represents the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to Catholic belief. The Trinity is shown here as God the Father holding the Crucified Christ with the dove representing the Holy Spirit between the two.

In some areas, work began with stylus underdrawing, which the artist then drew over and elaborated on with red chalk.Scholars are uncertain about the subject of this drawing and its purpose. The drawing probably copies another work of art,The Death of Marcus Curtius,painted by an artist close to Giovanni Battista Cima da Conegliano. The drawing includes very fewpentimenti, areas showing the artist making corrections and changing his mind, increasing the likelihood that the maker was following a pre-existing example. A copyist might have drawn in the black chalk arcs joining the horses' hooves as a guide, since they serve no compositional purpose.",

Silvy has done. The Vall\u00e9e de l'Huisne...[is a] true picture in which one does not know whether to admire more the profound sentiment of the composition or the perfection of the details.\"Early collodion-on-glass negatives, such as those Silvy used to render this scene, were particularly sensitive to blue light, making them unsuitable for simultaneously capturing definition in land and sky. Silvy achieved this combination of richly defined clouds and terrain by skillfully wedding two exposures and disguising any evidence of his intervention with delicate drawing and brushwork on the combination negative. The print exemplifies the tension between reality and artifice that is an integral part of the art of photography.The Huisne River provided power for flour and tanning mills and was significant in the history of Nogent-le-Rotrou, the town where Silvy was born. This photograph was taken from the Pont de Bois, a bridge over the river, looking toward the south and downstream. It was only a few minutes' walk from Silvy's birthplace. As the reviewer suggested, it is a sentimental image, an idyllic landscape full of reverence for and memory of a timeless place that was significant in the artist's development.",

Consumers from all over Europe coveted the colorlesscristallo,as it reproduced the brilliance and clarity of preciousrock crystal. In 1534 in Hall, Austria,Emperor Ferdinand Iopened one of the earliest manufactoriesproducingfa\u00e7on de Veniseglass in northern Europe. Wolfgang Vitl ran the workshop, employing both Venetian glassblowers and local craftsmen.Vitl and his successor Sebastian H\u00f6chstetter produced vessels that areItalianatein shape but larger and sturdier than genuine Venetian products. This goblet's flat foot and hollow stem imitate vessels produced in Murano fifty years earlier. But its body, molded in a pattern of drop-shaped protrusions painted in gold, white, and green, depends more on Germanic influences. Only traces of the paint remain, making it now impossible to guess the original design in gold or even to know how much of the goblet was covered.",

Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature. This varied intensity of line enabled the artist to give a sense of mass and three-dimensionality to the satyr.",

He fixed his original images, however, with a salt that did not actually remove the silver chloride, leaving the image unstable and still sensitive to light. In 1841, the year this picture was taken, he began printing more stable images by using a fixing agent called \"hypo,\" which thoroughly removed the silver chloride. Although the fuzziness of Talbot's first prints made his images in some ways less pleasing than the exactness of a daguerreotype, the process did allow multiple positive images to be created from a single negative.

Thick, charcoal-black lines delineate rippling muscles and slightly enlarged limbs. White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carre\u00f1o's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists.

Here the Virgin and Child sit in profile on an elaborate throne ornamented with a sphinx, a curling rinceaux motif, and various floral designs. Given the profile format, scholars believe this sheet was probably intended as a study for a relief, perhaps in terracotta.

Joseph enters through a doorway in the background.Although using oil, Reni applied his color with the broad brushwork of fresco painting. He outlined important details with dark, jagged strokes. It was once thought that the sketchy appearance of Reni's late works meant that they were unfinished, but like many aging artists, Reni pared form and color to the bare essentials for purely expressive purposes.Lost for centuries, this painting reappeared in the possession of a family in Michigan who sold it to the Getty Museum in 1984.",

Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, grasps his left hand urging him toward virtuous restraint. The god of wine, Bacchus, pours wine onto the young man to arouse his desires. Cupid, the tiny child-god of love, directs the youth's face toward his mother Venus who presses her right breast, emblematic of sybaritic pleasures.The entire surface of the vessel is carved and showcases the technical virtuosity of its maker, Balthasar Griessmann. This ivory specialist skillfully moved between different degrees of relief: from figures fully sculpted in three-dimensions to extremely shallow passages. Floral Bacchic motifs cover the lid, base, and stem of the vessel. Putti bearing fruit-laden garlands cavort around the lid, which is surmounted at the pinnacle with a single putto brandishing a cup in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. At the base lie recumbent drunken putti and satyrs.Griessmann faithfully derived the goblet's composition from a work by Otto van Veen,Allegory of the Temptations of Youth, known to the carver from a print by Antwerp artist Pieter Perret. Griessmann cunningly puts the allegory in the hands of the imbiber, who--like the youth--should consider the balance of indulgence with moderation. The virtuosity of the piece is such that it was most likely displayed at courtly banquets--a showpiece, to be viewed and admired, rather than utilized.",

The woman holds a basket filled with standard funerary offerings: ribbons, wreaths, andaryballoi, a type of small oil vessel. The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.",

Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877.

Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.",

Much of Mexico's rural population began moving to the capital around the time that Alvarez Bravo made this image. Their hardship and the disparity between the social classes became highly visible among Mexico's citizens, and in Alvarez Bravo's work.Alvarez Bravo used visual clues to illustrate the couple's social plight. By relegating the figures to the extreme lower foreground and filling the remainder of the composition with tree trunks and branches, Alvarez Bravo illustrated their lowly status. To symbolize the almost impossible task of improving one's circumstances, he cropped the couple's feet out of the photograph. At the same time, a beam of light falls across the left side of the image and onto the woman's figure, as if to signal that a better future may be forthcoming.",

He noticed even the most minute details, such as the nails in the floorboards and the brass door handle.

        "description":"In this sculpture, painting's basic building block, the brushstroke, has been playfully transformed into an oversized, three-dimensional form. Made from aluminum, three vertical \"strokes\" of pure color are frozen in space and rise to a height of more than ten feet. One edge of the yellow brushstroke cuts through the dominant stroke of black and blue; the yellow also curves into a diminutive stroke of red paint.Each brushstroke is a fully realized three-dimensional form that, somewhat implausibly, allows the viewer to experience a stroke of paint from different vantage points. The sculpture humorously reminds us that paint is literally three-dimensional.Roy Lichtenstein first explored brushstrokes as a subject in a series of paintings initiated in 1965. As with many of his works, he used a comic book source--a panel of an artist at work fromStrange Suspense Stories--as the basis for his brushstrokes. The subject became one of the artist's most recognizable images and he would return regularly to the brushstrokemotiffor more than thirty years. In the early 1980s, Lichtenstein began creating sculptural brushstrokes.",

Another son attempts to take a piece of buttered bread from the table while receiving an admonishing gesture from his father. Johann Zoffany, with his ability to portray lively figures interacting together in meticulous detailed settings, excelled at conversation pieces. These informal group portraits, introduced as a newgenreof painting in England in the 1700s, vividly recorded the settings and social customs of the time.Zoffany took care to include the details of the gentry's lives: Lady Louisa's shimmering light blue gown, the landscape painting above the fireplace mantel, the fineporcelaintea service, and the reflections on the highly polished silver urn. The sparse room also makes a statement about the family's social position.

Denis' confident paint handling and sensitive rendering of light capture the awe-inspiring power of nature. Using a warm palette, he juxtaposed light and dark tones to imply both the clouds' airy buoyancy and moisture-laden heaviness. Lively brushstrokes convey the constantly shifting forces of wind and light.This dramatic cloudscape predates by a century the Impressionists' celebration of outdoor landscape painting in which they recorded specific, yet fleeting, effects of weather and time and exhibited those results as finished paintings. But in Denis' time, oil sketching on paper while outdoors offered the artist an opportunity to test and sharpen his skills.

Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts. On August 20, 1786,Louis XVIpresented the Museum's tapestries to his sister-in-law, the duchess of Saxe-Teschen, and her husband the duke, the governors of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques.

The small stream descending in a waterfall provides another compositional axis. Muziano used the paper's blank areas to provide his brightesthighlightsand further capture the viewer's attention.As this drawing shows, Muziano's precise technique and cross-hatched shadows were readily translatable to the engraved line. He often supplied compositional drawings for engravings, and this sheet may have been apreparatory studyfor a print. The three variations on thiscompositionin other collections indicate that this drawing may also have originally been intended as part of a series on the penitent saints.

There, Rousseau incorporated aserpentinecreek with curved lines along the right side, leading to a distant, small town with a church. At the far left of the drawing, a person stands on the pathway, providing a sense of scale and distance.The artists of theBarbizon Schoolwere among the first to paint and drawenplein air, taking their tools outdoors to create their works of art, rather than inventing a scene from memory in a studio. In keeping with the Barbizon School's techniques, Rousseau captured the essence of the trees, giving them body and form, but rendered details such as leaves minimally with short strokes of chalk. The one gnarled, old tree at left that receives special attention becomes the focus of the image.On the verso, Rousseau used graphite to sketch trees surrounding a cottage.

No ancient author recorded the story of Herakles and Triton. This lack of literary sources for the depiction and the fact that it appears almost exclusively in Athenian art has led some scholars to look for a special meaning in the scene. The mythological battle may have had symbolic political significance for the Athenians.

The complexity and urgency of the process led to many technical mistakes, and Cameron's early attempts were no exception.

The emergence of a white-collar workforce in Germany during the 1920s vastly expanded opportunities for such new types of salaried employees as the bookkeeper, the bureaucrat, the secretary. Although rising employment rates were a positive development, Germany's volatile financial market during this period often meant that jobs were insecure.August Sander intended this image of a stern bank clerk to be part of his portfolio entitled \"The Official.\" The monumental cash register and the note in his hand inform the viewer of this man's monotonous role. Interestingly, only a few years before this picture was made, the value of German currency was so low that many people preferred to trade their Deutschmarks for American dollars, rather than to deposit them in a bank.",

        "description":"I have just finished a severed kanak [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention.--Paul GauguinWriting to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words \"Arii\" and \"Matamoe\" in the canvas' upper left. The first means \"noble;\" the second, \"sleeping eyes,\" a phrase that implies \"death.\"The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic \"primitivism.\" In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a \"primitive\" culture.",

He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness.

Ludovico Carracci chose to represent the moment after the subsequent deadly beating, when Roman soldiers dumped Sebastian's limp and lifeless body into a sewer.Against the dark of night, brutish soldiers lift and tug the dead saint's body. Ludovico contrasted the tensile strength of their straining bodies with the slackness of the saint's limbs, head, and facial muscles as he falls into the sewer's depths. The night atmosphere is dark and thick: figures seem to emerge from the blackness. Light glints dully off helmets and armor, but the soldiers' faces are unreadable. A bright light suffuses the body of Saint Sebastian, making him the focal point of the composition.In 1612 Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned this painting from Ludovico for his family's chapel in the Church of San Andrea della Valle in Rome. The chapel commemorated the site where Saint Sebastian's body was recovered from the sewer, called the Cloaca Maxima.

The artist, Francesco Antonio Franzoni, drew upon aclassicalvocabulary for the design, incorporatingputtiand Roman military objects around the frame. Military trophies adorn the relief, including a suit of armor, helmet, flags, shields, spears, axes, and the prow of a ship, referring to the family's illustrious political triumphs. The many religious emblems, such as achalice, cross,crozier, stole,miter, papal tiara, and keys of office were appropriate to this fireplace design because, as a member of the Braschi family, Pope Pius VI called this palace home.The loose handling of details apparent in the plumed helmet, the lion's face, and the military shields indicate that this was a preliminary sculptural sketch known as abozzetto.A nineteenth-century photograph shows the now-lost fireplace as it was eventually built, with green-and-white marble andgiltbronze emblems of the Braschi family.",

Castiglione \"drew\" with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting.

Vases from this period often depicted groups of boys or youths engaged in their usual activities: school, athletic training, and courting. The panel on the shoulder of this Athenianred-figurekalpis, however, shows a group of youths in a moment of relaxation. Accompanied by their dogs, the youths are conversing, either leaning on walking sticks or sitting, while one leans forward to tie his sandal.The kalpis was a new vase shape in the early 400s B.C. The rounded profile replaced the older, more angular form ofhydria, or water jar. Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis. Other features, such as the depiction of a scene from everyday life and the type of ornament framing the panel, also suggest that this vase comes from the later phase of the Kleophrades Painter's career.",

Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers.

At the same time, his tendency to treat the individual pieces of drapery as self-contained outlined forms illustrates his delight in examining the complex folds of cloth alone. In a closely hatched style, Brosamer enumerated not only the intricate patterns of the folds but also smaller details such as the skirt's vertical seam.",

He emphasized certain elements, subordinated others, and gave each landscape both unity and a poetic effect. Here he drew the trees with quick, thin strokes of the quill pen, suggesting their forms rather than specifically describing them. To emphasize the bulk of the tree at the left, he drew it darker and scratched through the paper's brown-tinted surface to create the white highlights.About ten years earlier, Rembrandt had begun drawing many landscapes. He roamed the area around Amsterdam, creating drawings and etchings that captured the Dutch countryside and its light and atmosphere, always with an economy of technique. As in this informal drawing, his landscapes express spontaneity and freshness while appearing like complete representations of the scenes he observed.",

This scene of Ajax and Achilles gaming was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Many scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase.

From a memoir written in the same year giving a detailed description of both cabinets, scholars know that both were originally veneered with panels of Japanese lacquer cut from a screen. The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques. The companion piece, now in the Royal Palace in Madrid, has been changed too; marquetry panels showing harbor scenes replaced the original lacquer.The mounts were cast by \u00c9tienne-Jean Forestier and Denis Bardin. They were chased by Pierre-Philippe Thomire and gilt by Claude Galle.",

His wiry limbs highlight his athleticism and potential for speed, but also convey fragility. His nakedness, as well as the sculpture's pocked surface, reinforces this vulnerability. A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.  In addition to producing many male busts, Frink created imposing, essentially anonymous men in a variety of poses or guises--standing, seated, spinning, winged, and on horseback. She began a series of running men in the mid-1970s. In this series, Frink explores and exploits the tension between strength and vulnerability, feeling and suffering.",

Protecting herself from the sun, she holds a small blue parasol and wears a bonnet. Touches of white--her gloves, sleeves, and flowing scarf--offset her blue and purple ensemble. Between her billowy sleeves and her gloves, the woman displays golden jewelry. She demurely reaches down with her left hand to hold up her voluminous dress. This mass of material contrasts sharply with her small head and single foot peaking out from below.The woman's immense dress would have been supported by an elaborate structure of crinolines or stiffened petticoats. Constantin Guys produced this drawing at the height of fashion for crinolines and full skirts. To suggest many layers of thin fabric, Guys built up layer upon layer of wash and repeating triangles drawn in ink. Guys' attention to contemporary fashion and make-up made him Charles Baudelaire's quintessential painter of modern life. But Baudelaire championed \"Monsieur G\" not merely for conveying appearances and artifice. For Baudelaire, Guys' watercolors and drawings not only captured his subjects in the present moment, but also imbued them with a look of timelessness, elevating them to the status of historical figures.",

The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia.

At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free.

The fine detail reveals even the minute check pattern of Frederick's vest and the subtle striping of his topcoat. He sits quietly, looking directly into the camera and holding what appears to be a closed daguerreotype case in his hands.Daguerreotypes were very delicate and the image could be scratched rather easily, so they were frequently mounted behind a glass and mat in a velvet-lined case. The Langenheims may have used this accomplished portrait in their studio window display to entice potential customers. The embossed word \"Exchange\" on the case lining indicates the street where their Philadelphia studios were located.",

One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing. Reyer's intense gaze contrasts sharply with the studied indifference of the object of his attention.At the top of this page, Degas set the stage for the scene: \"For a long time, Reyer has been offering a third-floor box [the cheapest theater box] to a washerwoman.\" On the right Reyer sheepishly offers a piece of paper to a washerwoman, who holds an iron close to her cheek in order to judge its heat.

Couples fondle one another in the more secluded spaces of a corner or balcony.Cornelis Dusart underscored his subjects' lewd behavior through suggestive details: rustic wooden furniture and earthenware jugs; food, pipes, and playing cards scattered about; patrons' ragged clothes and missing teeth. He used a sharpened piece of hard black chalk to draw on the smooth vellum and gray ink to define shadow areas; media that provide a light but fine rendering.The type of iconography depicted in this drawing was central to a genre of Dutch art in which everyday people are engaged in common activities. Drawings were often framed and hung, or simply pinned up, on the walls of middle-class homes. This large-scale drawing served as a finished work of art, but Dusart also made a painting of the same scene.",

The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.",

Manuel Deutsch and such contemporaries as Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Albrecht Aldorfer employed the technique of drawing on a deeply colored ground with white strokes delineating contours or modeling figures. Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink. Next he brushed in the lavish whiteheightening, refined additional details in black ink, and touched in Christ's halo with gold pigment.",

Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.",

Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space. Masterfully handling a difficult medium, van Gogh revealed the luminosity of watercolor and hinted at the expressiveness and colorful palette of his art to come.",

        "description":"This miniature originally appeared in a manuscript expressly created for Philip the Good, the duke of Burgundy that consists of a compilation of accounts of the miracles of the Virgin Mary. Philip was a highly successful political leader of his day as well as an important and influential patron of manuscript illumination. The witty scene illustrates a noblewoman's endeavor to deal with her husband's Christian mistress. In the chapel at right, the wife of the adulterous knight prays for the Virgin Mary to avenge her by punishing the mistress. However, Mary refuses the request on account of the adulteress's deep devotion to her. Subsequently when wife and mistress encounter one another in the street the mistress is so embarrassed--she falls to her knees--she promises to give up the husband. Meanwhile the wayward husband cowers behind the chapel. Given the duke's own serial philandering--he fathered several dozen children outside his marriage and relatively few within it--one cannot help but wonder how he responded to this moralizing tale.The miniature is painted entirely in grey tones, a technique called grisaille, popular in the later Middle Ages. Despite the lack of color, the illuminator, Lieven van Lathem, vividly evokes the buildings and cobblestone streets of a prosperous Netherlands town such as Ghent where van Lathem, the court painter of Philip the Good, resided.",

Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding.

He appears unaware of the precarious position of the earthenware pitcher in his left hand. The peasant's intemperate state showcases Cornelis Dusart's ability to capture the human form in an unusual pose, as well as his delicate modeling of the sitter's rumpled clothes and ruddy features.Continuing the genre tradition established by his teacher Adriaen van Ostade, Dusart specialized in depictions of peasant life. Like Van Ostade, Dusart produced studies exploring variations in pose and expression of single, seated figures. But the use of red chalk--often highlighting hands and face--was Dusart's own innovation.",

The trees are dwarfed and stunted. Tundra covers much of the interior; arctic and alpine wildflowers bloom in seemingly unlimited abundance in summer. But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed. Iceland's luxurious mosses, which blanket the region instead of forests, first drew Porter to visit the island in 1972. This photograph displays their startling range of colors and textures. Rocks rounded and smoothed by river water are draped with splotches of rust, yellow, gold, and green.In 1972, the Sierra Club published Iceland, a portfolio of twelve dye transfer prints in an edition of 110. Porter also wanted to publish a book on the subject, but he could not find a publisher.  Undaunted, Porter persisted and seventeen years later, it was published. The book contains an essay by Porter's son Jonathan, who often traveled with him. In the foreword, Jonathan wrote: \"Iceland possesses a primordial quality, as if one were a time traveler viewing an earlier formative age of the earth.\" Porter's close-up views, like this one, convey that uniqueness.",

I not only saw the old man there, but mentally, the old lady, and the interior of the cottage...The old man, by his attitude and expression, gave the germ of the idea; the old lady had to be found, and the cottage built, but they appeared to me then quite visibly and solidly.When Day's Work is Doneexists in more copies than any other photograph by Robinson. The photograph is acombination printmade from six different negatives, a significant technical accomplishment. The negatives were attached in pairs to a sheet of glass for support, and the final image was made in three printings of those pairs.The line between the light-colored wall behind the woman and the dark shadows of the room, a stage set built for the photograph, reveals one of the seams between negatives.

Adjusting the focus of her handheld 2 1\/4-inch format camera, she rotated 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction to create a loosely structured panorama.

        "description":"Given the ornamental character of this drawing and the scene's relative lack of movement, court artist Francesco Primaticcio probably made it as a preparatory study for costume designs for a festival. The color notes that he included also support the idea of a costume design, since the assistants in his workshop would have needed such notes to faithfully re-create his design in fabric. Several of his other costume designs include elaborately decorated helmets such as the one this centaur wears. Primaticcio probably depicted only one element in a larger composition celebrating the popular story of the neighboring tribes of the centaurs and the Lapiths. According to classical mythology, the Lapiths invited the centaurs to their king's wedding, but the centaurs responded by carrying off the Lapith women-even the bride-under the influence of wine. The battle that ensued ended with the centaurs' defeat and expulsion from the Lapiths' country.",

        "description":"Always captivated by gesture and motion, in the 1870s Edgar Degas became interested in ballet dancers and particularly in the youngest ballerinas of thecorps. During frequent visits to Paris's ballet school, he found what interested him most: movement--not free and spontaneous action but precise exercises. On this crowded sheet, one dancer practices at the bar in the upper left with her back toward the viewer, while two others with legs extended lean over on the right. It was the studied position of each girl's legs that fascinated the artist; he often did not even bother to finish the top half of the body. In the bottom right corner, he quickly sketched a group of four dancers, their heads together in deep discussion, with the observant head of the ballet master just visible behind them.Using quick, even careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures with abrupt lines as if he was impatient to record each woman's posture or hand movement in the most emphatic terms without sacrificing swiftness or spontaneity. He wasted no time to give depth to the forms with unnecessary shading or hatching; the finger he dragged over the tutu of the dancer at the top left created a smudgy shadow that simply suggests the garment's fabric.",

This sculpture is one of a pair of tabletop bronzes that show a wild beast brutally killing a domesticated animal. Although the pair are based onantiquemodels, the animal subject and intense emotionalism are characteristic of the late 1500s and early 1600s.In a play of space and movement, theManneristsculptor Giambologna arranged the figures' limbs in a circle. Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and\/or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture.

Nude, her drapery falling down upon her legs, she rests on a rock amidst seashells. According to myth, Venus was born from the foam of the sea, an aspect of her legend suggested by the sculpture's title, Venus Marina. Although cupid or a dolphin usually accompanies Venus Marina, neither are present here.This tabletop bronze was made after a model attributed to the French sculptor Robert Le Lorrain. As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms. Other similar Venus figures attest to the popularity of this genre of sculpture in France in the early 1700s.",
