Fifteen years earlier Fitzgerald had had great success with her Cole Porter Songbook and this date, even with a few hokey arrangements, almost reaches the same level. Trumpeter Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and pianist Tommy Flanagan are among the supporting cast. Highlights include \"I Get a Kick out of You, I've Got You Under My Skin, All of You, My Heart Belongs to Daddy and Just One of Those Things.\" --Scott Yanow",
