Dressed in a red collared shirt and eyeglasses, he appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s.  His proper left profile is shown and his head is tilted slightly downward.  His appearance is rather bohemian, with a goatee and a scraggly mustache.  In the background Heart Mountain looms in the bottom left corner, above a meandering river and the sky is dark and cloudy.  The artist uses a palette of muted colors (pale coral, soft gold, icy aqua and warm peach) to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The figure is centrally placed in the canvas, and the diagonal thrust to his neck provides a more dynamic composition.  To accentuate details within the figure, the artist used fine contour lines, especially about the features (eyes, ears, nose, and lips) and the waves of the hair.  The style of painting is realistic with elements of Asian calligraphic brush strokes in the finer details.  Frame has light hint of green paint.  The painting is a study of a man lost in introspection.  Although the uniquely shaped mountain identifies the location as Heart Mountain, Wyoming, the man's thoughts appear to be far away.  By showing Heart Mountain in the background however, the artist appears to be contrasting the man reflecting on his previous life compared to the confines of the present.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>Block 329-13-G \/ Poston, Arizona \/ October 20, 1942 \/ Dear Miss McNary, \/ This is the little black samble Louise wondering how you have been. I haven't written for so long that I'm ashamed of myself. If you happen to see a red glow before your eyes think nothing about it because it's just the reflection from my face. I bet the library is sworming with students now! \/ Here in Poston the weather is gradually getting cooler, but it is still hot. In the morning, it is very chilly but as the time ticks away it gets warmer and warmer. I imagine in San Diego it is raining. So far we had 2 rainy days. The funny thing about it was--it was hot from early morn. Towards sunset it became a little windy. Then after supper--6:30 P.M.--the wind blew, the rain poured, the thunder roared, and the lightning flashed. The wind was very strong. It tore down a few doors. Everyone was waiting for the roofs to blow off so they can have wood to make tables, chairs, closets etc. But there was no such luck. Then the next day it was hot again. \/ School has finally begun. I am a senior now, but I am not sure if I got credit for the last semester. When we graduate, we are going to receive California diplomas. I am taking the following subjects: \/ 1st &amp; 2nd period - Miss Warvorwsky \/ History and English (we are now studying the history of Poston) \/ 3rd period - part time work as reader. \/ 4th \" - Shorthand II Mr. Nishimoto \/ 5th \" - work \/ 6th \" - Physiology - Mr. Anderson. Rumors are that he wears a wig. \/ 7th &amp; 8th - work. \/ Many of the rooms are not furnished with tables, chairs as yet. So we have to take our own chairs. The lower grades have tables. \/ I am working part time as a reader. Margaret Ishino is working too. We sit in the office and wait for teachers to bring in their papers to be corrected. I go to school at 8:00 A.M. until 12 noon. Then from 1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M. Then I either wash, iron, or play. \/ October 17th, 18th and 19th there was a County Fair which was held in Camp 1. Emi Himaka, Haruko + Kikuye Kawamoto, and I went to the fair on Saturday. We rode on an army truck to Camp 1.Camp 1 does not differ very much from Camp 3. The fair reminded me of a carnival. There were many game booths. And, of course, stands where various foods were sold. Many things were on display. Many future plans were on display too. Many Japanese foods are going to be planted. Noodles are already being made in Camp 1. There is a poultry farm too. At present there are 50 chickens. A pork farm is going to be located between Camp 1 and Camp 2. Many things are going to be made here and sold to the outside--exports. The thing I enjoyed the most was the Arts and Craft display. Many clever things were made from trunks and branches of trees. There are many talented people here. I wish you were there to enjoy it with me. \/ As you may have noticed, I have moved. I am now living in Block 329-13-G; Poston, Arizona. I am not living with my step-mother any more as you can imagine how busy I am washing, ironing, cleaning the house, and going to school. I never realized how men can dirty their clothes. I am kept busy but I will try to write more often. \/ I suppose you remember about the clothing allowance. Well, we finally received them. I received: \/ 1 red bedroom slipper \/ 1 flannel pajama \/ 8 prs. of sock \/ 1 slip \/ 1 wool slacks \/ I was hoping the skirt and jerkin set would come but to my disappointment it did not. But I am grateful to receive such nice things. \/ I told you in my last letter that we do not have mattresses, but now we have straw mattresses. It softens and warms the bed. My, once I start writing I never seem to stop. It's time for me to go to bed so I'll say good-nite and please take care of yourself since it's getting colder each day. \/ Most sincerely, \/ Louise Ogawa",

Transcription:<br>July 22, 1943\/Poston, Ariz.\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I am sorry I did not write sooner, but since my mother is working in the canteen, I have to keep care of the house, and besides that, I go to summer school in the morning.\/I suppose the weather over in S. D. is rather hot, but I don't suppose you could very well call this weather over here cold.\/Nothing very much has happened here. My mother went to see about a berry-picking job outside, and the at office said she didn't look like a farmer's wife.\/ I went one day to the canteen to see my mother when a boy asked me if my mother was my sister. Everybody laughed.\/My mother came home one night and told me that when she asked one of the clerks what time it was, she said, \"Oh, my time is ten cents fast.\"\/I was looking over my letters when I noticed you wrote me the most, with Miss Fay coming in close with one less than you.\/Now, Miss Breed, I hope I'm not asking too much, but I would like to have a few paper-dolls. Miss McNary sent me one, and I had one which a baby broke. If you please, I would much rather prefer the ones in book form, (which I think are available at Woolworth's) but if they can't be had, the ones that come in boxes are all right. I will send fifty cents which will cover the mailing cost as well as for the paper dolls.\/ I hope you don't think I'm asking too much of you.\/<br>Always with Love,\/Katherine Tasaki\/P.S.\/I have sent a sample dress to show you the kind of flap I want. I have marked with an x so you will know what I mean. Also say \"hello\" to everyone for me.\/(over)\/Tell me what has happened to Annies son. If she is still going to the library would you be so kind as to find her address for me?",

Transcription:<br>District 1\/Barrack 7 Unit 1 Avenue 7\/Santa Anita Assembly Center\/Arcadia, California\/May 7, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/About a month has gone by but we are still as happy as we were two years ago, and I am looking forward to the future when all this will be over.\/How are you, Miss Breed? I hope you are in the best of health!!!\/Since school has not started yet I decided to do something else besides washing, ironing, and cleaning the rooms. I finally got a job as a waitress. Once I start serving tea I don't know whether I am coming or going. There is not enough girls so we serve 3 or 4 tables, and it certainly keeps us busy.\/We now have a newspaper called the Santa Anita Pacemaker. It is published twice a week. I thought maybe you would like to read it so I was going to send it to you, but my mother threw it away. I shall send the next publication to you.\/There are about 11,984 people in this assembly center now. The capacity for this center is estimated to be between 17,000 and 18,000. More inductees are on schedule to arrive this week. There are so many people here that the cooks have to use shovels to transfer food from one pan to another.\/We had an enjoyable evening last night at the community singing. Community singings are held once a week.\/My, the book, The Singing Sisters, certainly is an interesting book! I enjoyed it tremendously.\/The dinner bell is ringing but before closing I would like to thank you for everything and hope you will write during your leisure hours for than that spark of loneliness will soon fade away. Please give my regards to Miss McNary.\/Very sincerely yours,\/Louise Ogawa",

I'm going to save the candied nuts for New Year's.\/Last night went to listen to the mass choir made up of the choirs of all three camps. Under the full moon the program was truly impressive Enclosed is the program.\/On Dec 11-13 we had a Xmas Bazaar here in Camp III. The proceeds are to buy Xmas presents for the children of all three camps. People came from the other camps so the crowd was huge. The Bazaar was quite a success with many things sold out within 2 hours after opening.\/I'll try to write again soon. Am closing so as to make the afternoon mail.\/Sincerely\/Ted",

Transcription:<br>Dec. 22, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Thank you ever so much Santa!!!!! I cannot express in words how I feel. I feel so happy I feel like shouting from the house top to let the world know how I feel.\/I am not going to open a single gift until Xmas. Every minute I have a chance I look and look at the beautifully wrapped gifts wondering what they are. One thing I know is--one of them is a book. But what is the name of it? Another package sounds like Christmas candy. Oh, you just can't imagine how my curiosity is trying to get the best of me--but it won't succeed!!\/I hope you found what little I sent enjoyable. The mosquite plack was made here in Poston III. It is one of the products of the Industry Dept. The flowers were made by my mother. Two of them were made into a corsage by a friend. I would have liked to wax them before I sent it but not being able to I sent it as they were.\/<br>On Dec. 11, 12, 13th a Christmas Bazaar was held for the benefit of raising funds to buy toys for all the little children of Poston III. This was so every child will have a very merry Xmas. Everyone seemed to have liked this idea and the bazaar was a great success.\/As I sit out in the warm sun writing this letter, I hear voices and hear people scurrying about. To satisfy my curiosity I turned around to see what was the matter. The block manager has come ot notify us that the water will be turned off--not knowing for how long. Now I see all the ladies carrying buckets full of water into their homes. I must lay my pen down for I too must get some water.\/Now to continue writing again. In the last letter I mentioned about the building of the fence. I am happy to say now that the fences are no longer around us--it has been torn down.\/On Dec. 21st I enjoyed the beautiful Christmas carols sung by the mass choir of 200 voices. They composed of people from the three camps. It was held outdoors in the evening and oh, it was beautiful.\/The movies here are wonderful. We have seen such good movies as Union Pacific, Son of Fury, How Green Was My Valley, A Yank in the R.A.F. and many more. Every Friday nite is our movie night and everyone has an enjoyable evening.\/I am again going to take advantage of your kindness and ask you to please purchase 3 Jockey shorts for men at Walkers. The size is 28 waist. I am enclosing $1.60 in money order. If this is not sufficient please let me know and I shall send them before you can say \"Jack Robinson.\" You purchased them before while I was in Santa Anita.\/This new year I must resolve not to bother you so much as I did this year. You are so busy and yet I ask you for this and that. You should come here and spank me. But in another thought I'd be much happier if you'll come to visit and just let that spanking slip your mind. But seriously I do hope you will be able to come and visit us. I know that dream may be shattered because of the gas rationing and you are so busy.\/Now, I would like to know how everything is with you. I hope your are in the finest of health and hope the library work doesn't over-work you!\/We send our seasons greetings to one and all and sincerely hope the new year will bring much happiness to you and your mother.\/Most sincerely,\/Louise Ogawa\/I am enclosing one of the editions of the school paper. Hope you'll enjoy reading it.",

We boarded this pullman train about 9:00 p.m. and pulled out of the station about 10:30. In Phoenix we joined a group who came from Gila. We had a late supper and since the lights were dimmed went to bed.\/ We had a rather restless night due to the occasional jerking of the train. I feel fine but mother is a bit car sick.\/ Pop will be waiting for us when we get there on Sunday, according to our escort.\/ Will write again soon.\/Just\/Fusa",

She has silver hair and  yellow-beige skin.  Dressed in a sleeveless pink dress and gray hat, the woman walks barefoot between two large barracks in foreground in the early dawn indicated by the pale rose and lemony glow of the sky.  She appears to be holding a set of keys in her proper right hand.  Her shadow, a large green misshapen version of her body, looms behind her in left foreground.  The road is flanked by dark gray barracks lined up in regimented rows, some with terra cotta colored chimneys, and recedes into the distance toward the base of the flat-topped mountain.  Her sight appears to be fixated on the grayish-green shape of Heart Mountain.  <br>The artist uses a palette of softly muted colors -- primarily pale salmon pink, olive and khaki greens, maize yellow and gray tinged with lavender.  The scene has an early morning yellow glow.  The composition of the painting is made up of diagonals (the stance of the woman's figure in motion, the roof lines of the buildings in the foreground, the twist of the woman's shadow, and the diagonal lines of linear perspective).  The diagonal composition gives the painting a dynamic and active quality.  The artist also employs a twist on perspective.  The viewer sees the painting from a bird's eye view, and thus views the top of the roofs of the barracks.  Yet the perspective of the buildings fading into the distance makes it appear as if the viewer is located on ground level.  Perhaps the artist's intent in tweaking the perspective was to put the viewer in the mindset of a person who is trapped with nowhere to go.  It is unclear whether the woman is floating above the ground or is anchored firmly to it.  It may be intentional or incomplete.  Painting appears to be unfinished.  Stairs are roughed out but not painted, and some barracks are not outlined -- inconsistency in amount of details shown.  The painting allows the viewer to enter into the psyche of the concentration camp prisoner.  She is anonymous, faceless, yet longing for a world beyond the gray barracks.  She watches the dawns rise above the mountain giving her hope.  The keys that she holds also symbolizes the yearning for freedom.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>Sept. 17, 1942\/Dear Miss McNary,\/I received your letter dated August 31st today. I certainly was glad to hear from you! It stayed in Santa Anita for about 2 weeks. I imagine you were wondering when I was going to answer your letter. It certainly took a long time for them to forward it to me, but I imagine they were quite busy.\/You probably have heard all about Poston, Arizona from Miss Breed. We are living in the No. 3 Camp. If not I shall be more than happy to inform you of my new home.\/Miss McNary, I wish I could take a natural colored picture of myself to show you that it's pretty hard ot compete in the sun-tanning contest with me. But unfortunately we are not allowed to have cameras. But we are allowed to carry flashlights. Miss McNary, I would just love to have a picture of you!!!\/I am glad to hear you had a nice vacation. I was with you in spirit at the beach. Sorry you were not able to come and see us during your stay in Los Angeles. My stay there would have been perfect if you came to see us.\/I am working as a waitress at the present time. I am going to school when it opens October 5th. I am most happy to know that I'll be able to finish high school. My teachers are coming from California to teach us. It certainly would be nice if some of my former teachers came!\/The Government gave us a clothing allowance for the months we were in Santa Anita. I was allowed $13.00 for the 4 months. We were given a list of items from which we could order through the Sears catalog. Thinking we were going to a cold place, everyone ordered winter clothes--wool slacks, heavy sweaters, wool skirts, heavy shirts etc. If we were informed as to where we were going we would have ordered things to suit the climate of Poston. Unfortunately we were not. As yet we have not received our clothing.\/Poston is a wonderful place--way out in the open spaces. It would be paradise if it were not for the dust, heat and the insects.\/It was very interesting to read about San Diego. I could imagine what a change the dim out has made.\/There seems to be a urgent call for farmers all over the United States. Many of the San Diego boys are going out of this camp to Oregon, Utah, Colorado, Idaho to help with the farm work--picking cotton, tomato, beets etc. I heard they are to return here in a few months for there is no work in those states during the winter time. But while there if they find work outside, they can call their family over there and stay permanently. Of course, then no Govt. help will be provided for they are on their own. My girl friend is in Colorado and she informed me that because of the labor shortage the schools are open just half a day. All the school children help out in the fields the rest of the day.\/Have you had a blackout recently? I certainly miss them! During our first blackout in San Diego we had so much excitement at home--bumping into doors, tables, chairs; trying to dress in the dark; father taking a bath in the dark etc. Here there is no curfew or blackouts. I guess it is far enough inland to it isn't necessary to have any.\/There rings the dinner bell!! My tummy has been growling for hours so I'd better run!!\/Please write soon and keep trying--maybe you'll win over me in that blackout competition yet! Hope you'll always be in the best of health.\/Most sincerely,\/Louise Ogawa\/My address is: \/Block 330\/Bldg. 12 Apt. B\/Poston, Arizona\/Ps. I thought your stationary was darling!! Everyone gave such nice comments on it. The green ink went so well with the stationary.",

        "description":"Stretched and framed.  Image of an older woman hunched over holding a sinuous bright yellow cat while standing in profile on a purple mesa overlooking a river or lake.  She wears a green blouse, lavender scarf and navy blue skirt; her hair is red and her skin is a peachy gold.  A green mountain emerges from the blue water in background.  Overall, the land is orange fading to rose, and the sky is a clear lemon.  Small orange and yellow flowers and shrubs peek from various crevices in the mesa.<br>When first gazing at the painting, one can not help but notice the dazzling colors of the artist's palette.  Undiluted, the artist, uses ultramarine blue, crimson and yellow in the central figures of the woman and cat, immediately drawing the viewer's eyes.  The secondary colors of green, orange and violet also lead the viewer through the painting.  The style of the painting is synchromistic with an emphasis on using color harmony to capture form and mood.  The shapes of the painting (the mountain, mesa and woman's blouse) are biomorphic and rounded, undulating with a rhythm similar to the paintings of Thomas Hart Benton, a contemporary of the artist and Stanton MacDonald-Wright.  The painting is symbolic in the images it presents.  The huddled and tense woman has her hand on her face and appears to be pondering a decision or awaiting something fearful.  The cat stretches out his neck suspiciously.  The woman is looking down at a river indicating flow and constant change and motion.  The mountain or mesa top that the woman stands on is unyielding and unmoving - yang (passive) to the river's yin.  One interpretation may be that the woman has to forsake an area with which is stable and unchanging and forced to confront some type of change -- unknown and potentially dangerous.  It may be the woman is looking beyond the confines of the World war II concentration camp and anxious about her uncertain future beyond the walls and barbed wire.",

        "description":"3 letters and envelope sent together from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>October 8, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ Tick tock tick tock goes the clock on my dresser. Yes, the old man time must have ticked a million times since I last wrote to you. I hope this letter finds you fine and dandy and as bright as a sunflower. I certainly missed hearing from you! We are all just fine though the mornings and nights are getting cold. \/ Nothing much has occurred except for the intestinal flu which is going around camp now. I was very fortunate (?) to have it visit me. If I ate just a little, my stomach notified me of its arrival. I just couldn't eat anything for it would hurt my tummy. I was very sad for I just love to eat! And it so happened we had pie-turnovers; nice juicy grapes--delicious foods all through the day. What a day to be sick!!! It was torture to see all that food just sitting on the tray before me. Well, I am just fine now and am just dying to see those turn-overs again. \/ We are kept quite busy these days at the office since school will commence Monday, October 11th. The new adobe schools are practically completed. The wooden frame work is painted a pretty blue. I imagine all the children will have a very nice school year with new teachers, books, tables, chairs and above all a new real school. I certainly do envy them! \/ My girl friends and I often talk of our future. Now I wish I took another major instead of commercial. It may be my depressed mood but I feel after I am outside, I won't be able to make use of my shorthand. I think something like cosmetology or teaching would have been more useful. I always did want to teach English to little children in Japan. But to do that, I will have to have a college education and I did not take a college prep. course. Whenever we discuss these things, we always end up where we started from. \/ Hisako tells me you are going around telling stories to little children. I imagine you have loads of fun with them. I'd love to listen to you too. \/ After I tell you the following news, you'll think I joined the band of the moving Poston indians. I am going to move again. We are moving back to block 330 this Tuesday. I'll probably be lost among our belongings for several weeks, like I always am. If I come out of it in one piece, I'll write and inform you of all the trouble we had in the process of moving. But I'll always be glad to hear from you whether I am sandwiched by the suitcases, or in the closet or under the cots. \/ I am anxious to see tonights movie, This Above All. My girl friends in other relocation centers write and say how much they enjoyed it and now we are going to have the privilege of seeing it. \/ Having stolen an hour of my working time, I'll get down to business like a good little girl. \/ Most respectfully, \/ Louise Ogawa \/ I just saw the biggest and longest whirl wind. One of the teachers commented that it's like seeing the Old Faithful at her most powerful stage. It was unbelievably large. \/ October 10, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ After reading your letter, I thought I'd wait until the sweater came. This waiting is killing me. Saturday we had another down-pour so the mail was not delivered. I can hardly wait until tomorrow. Thank you ever so much for all the trouble I caused you! \/ Thank you for the advice on sewing a ribbon across the back of the neck. I shall do that the very first thing. \/ Your friend certainly did have a strange experience. I can just imagine how crowded the trains and hotels are by your letter. I'll be sure to have someone go out with me when I go! \/ Yes, I still am employed at the school office. I am now classified as a stenographer. I take dictation, type letters, Transcriptions to be sent out to various schools where students have entered, take care of the dittoing and mimeography (cutting stencils etc.), file, answer the telephone, and taking care of teachers' reports, memos, etc. This work gives me experience in many different line",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 23, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I just received the two intensely interesting books which you so kindly sent. I was overwhelmed with joy to see the books when the postman opened the package for inspection. I cannot express in words my feeling of gratitude.\/I want to thank you so much that I feel like writing pages and pages of \"Thank you, Miss Breed, Thank you!\" But I shall not for I must conserve on paper. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. The first thing I did after receiving the books was run to my parents and show them the nice books. Then I ran to Margaret Ishino and showed them to her. I was so happy I had to show them to someone.\/Yesterday began my third week in Santa Anita. It is a beautiful place. It is the first time I have been here and I enjoy it very much. The weather differs greatly from San Diego. It is cold and rainy one day and the next day it is as hot as it could be.\/Since I have been here I visited Seabiscuit's statue and have gone around the race track a few times.\/We are fed three meals a day and the food is just fine. This is just like an army camp for the store is called a canteen and the cafeteria is called a mess hall. Everyday a line is, which people refer to as a bread line, formed leading to the mess hall when meal time is near. This line is blocks and blocks long. I often wait an hour or two before entering the mess hall. The mess hall is a huge room. The other morning I was the one thousandth person to enter it..\/It took me a while to get use to my new home, but I am quite use to it now. I am sleeping where Seabiscuit used to sleep, I hope. \"I am sleeping where Seabiscuit used to sleep\" is a common saying around here.\/School has not started yet and I am getting lonesome for homework. I heard we are going to have a library soon. It was the best news I have heard. I just love to read. By just looking at the books you sent, I recall the days when I use to walk to the library and have you help me find a nice book to enjoy.\/The first week after we arrived, father, brother, sister, and I went everyday to the scrap wood pile to find wood to make our furnitures. We finally gathered enough wood to make a few tables and chairs. After looking at the results I thought of the primitive people who did what we did today.\/But bitter feelings do not enter my head because I know we were sent to Santa Anita Assembly Center for our own protection. I am grateful to the Govt. for gathering us in such a nice place. If I am helping the Govt. by staying here, I am glad. I want so much to be of some use to the Govt.\/My! all I have been doing is talking about myself. Now I would like to know how you are and all about San Diego. I imagine many students come to the library to get reference books. I wish I was still among them! I seem to be going on and on like the ticking of a clock, but the running out of ink has told me to stop. Before closing I would like to thank you again and I certainly would appreciate your correspondance.\/Very sincerely yours,\/Louise Ogawa\/(over)\/My address is:\/Louise Yoshiko Ogawa\/Santa Anita Assembly Center\/Barrack 7 Avenue 7 Apt. #1\/Santa Anita, California\/Ps. I shall anxiously await your letter.\/",

Foreground right, a man in blue is bent under the weight of a large tied box with writing on top, \"To Rohwer Relocation Camp,\" and white tag with family number on his back.  A small boy in a black and white striped shirt walks to his left and points with his right hand to the upper left where a ghostly image of Christ bearing the Cross is visible against a background of barbed wire fences, trees and dark cloudy skies.  Both face away from the viewer.  [Similar to the painting entitled \"Thinking about Christ,\" also by Sugimoto, 92.97.83]  In the lower left an elderly couple sits on tied bundles amongst other luggage in front of a barracks.  The man, dressed in tan and brown, bends forward as he holds a hat in his lap, while the woman in a dark blue dress with white trim leans forward and holds a book in her lap.  Between them, her purse and a filled pail sits on a box while umbrella leans against it. [Similar to the painting entitled \"Praying for Safety,\" also by Sugimoto, 92.97.44]   At midground a soldier in uniform and MP armband stands with rifle and bayonet at at barbed wire fence.  To the right, a woman in a polka dot dress and apron stands at the gap in fence as she carries a child in yellow on her back and waves goodbye to the soldier leaving camp.  A little girl in red waves an American flag next to the post with a sign that reads, \"STOP.\"  A man with a pipe, hat and plaid shirt watches from the right behind the fence.  The Nisei soldier in tan uniform and garrison cap looks over left shoulder bidding his family farewell as he leaves camp with one blue bag on a path winding past a watch tower with guard and a large sign, \"Jerome Relocation Center \/ War Relocation Authority.\"  The path is grey bordered by brown grass.  Upper right corner, vision of a hill with three white crosses against the sky, representing Golgatha - Christ carrying cross toward Golgatha.

Transcription:<br>Dear Miss Breed, \/Thank you most sincerely for sending the things I asked to be purchased as well as the candies, clips, and the cute little shoes. I am always in a pridicament (is that the correct spelling?) when it comes to thanking you. I just can't seem to express my deepest gratitude in words. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\/Miss Breed, I know the remaining money will not go even half way in paying for the candies, clips, etc. but please keep it. Now we are even. You owe me nothing and I owe you nothing. No debts--in money I mean. I certainly owe a debt of gratitude to you that is higher than the highest mountain in the word. I shall never forget it and maybe someday I will be able to repay you.\/I gave Florence the little doll and she was overjoyed. Everytime I see her she says--I tried it last night and I could see the doll in the dark\" She seems to be so thrilled. I am sure she is cherishing it with her life.\/Yes, that nickname \"Roastem, Toastem, Postem\" certainly is true! I am being roasted and toasted by the ever-shining Poston sun. You may not believe this but in the mornings 6:30 A.M. no one wears a sweater or coat for it is warm.--In the evenings, 9:00 P.M., people are walking about without wraps.\/Tuesday, May 11th, the first group of volunteers left for Salt Lake City to be inducted into the U.S. Army. I beg your pardon it was Monday--May 10th.\/19 boys from Camp III; 5 boys from Camp II; 12 boys from Camp I.\/A procession of trucks with one volunteer on each truck left Poston III and headed for Poston I. Camp II joined in the procession--making 24 trucks full of people going one after another. It certainly was a sight to see.\/In Camp I a talent show was held in honor of the boys. Also at this time administration officials spoke. Then at 8:45 P.M. all the volunteers hopped on the awaiting bus. Leaving a puff of smoke behind them they were off to fight for our country, U.S.A. It was a sad but yet a happy parting. I felt so sorry for the mothers.\/Well, graduation is slowly drawing near. We are going to wear cotton, sheer, dresses of pastel colors.\/I shall be glad to send you a picture just as soon as it arrives.\/Well, that's about all the news for today.\/Miss Breed, I certainly wish you would come to Poston but I suggest you come a little later when it is not so hot.\/Hope to hear from you again soon and please give my best to Miss McNary.\/Most respectfully,\/Louise Ogawa<br>",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Blk. 323-11-D\/Poston, Arizona\/June 27, 1943\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Thank you very much for sending me the letter, clipping on the N.Y.A., and cross word puzzles. Some of those puzzles are mighty confusing. I noticed on top of the N.Y.A. clipping that Etta Kett still manages to go out with fellows on automobiles on dates despite gas rationing and also tire rationing. She must have what it takes--or is that only in the comic strips?\/Tetsuo explained to me why you were unable to come to visit us. We realize--\"business before pleasure\" is just one of those unavoidable things. From your accounts of your vacation you really had a good time despite some of the hectic moments. Nowadays vacation must mean doing anything out of the ordinary, then going back to work for a rest! For us one of the hardest things for us to realize is that every moment counts on the outside--in here one day is the same as the rest and no one is in a hurry to get anywhere.\/My sister is in Minneapolis, Minnesota with her husband doing domestic work. She says they don't like the work, so they have given notice to quit. After the 30th they will move elsewhere in Minn. Jobs are plentiful there, but the housing situation seems to be acute as in other cities. They are planning  to rent an apartment with another couple. She says for me to stick around here for a while longer until they get settled. However, with more and more people leaving it leaves me feeling restless with an urge to go out. <br>\/My brother, Yuki, is now working on a farm in Milwaukee. Due to some tie up with the Federal Reserve Banks he hasn't been able to withdraw the money which was to keep him in school. He is planning to work until about Nov., then enter school again. He claims that to become a doctor (a full fledged M.D.) is an \"obsession\" with him and he will attain his goal regardless of the amount of years and amount of work he has to do. Mother was worried for fear that after he started working he would not care to go back to school, but now has been rather assured by him that it will not be so. I'm glad for his sake that he plans to become something of value to mankind. I hope and pray that he will make a fine doctor someday.\/I can't imagine what you mean by \"the rest of the week---was foggy and cold----and we had to wear coats and suits most of the time.\" That to me would be paradise! We roast in this hot sun all day and can't sleep until after ten!\/The crickets are in their full glory. They get into our clothes and mostly on our nerves. If they would only get together and make some decent melody! They jump like grasshoppers and scare me more that I scare them when I try to catch them. \/<br>Does your sister still correspond with many of us nisei's or is she too busy right now? \/Well, Miss Breed, don't work too hard. Let me hear from you soon.\/Sincerely,\/Fusa Tsumagari",

A greying Sugimoto, dressed in a dark suit and black tie, gazes directly ahead through black-rimmed glasses.  Around his neck he wears a white ribbon with red stripes tied in bow above a five-pointed yellow star with a red circular design in its center. On his left breast are two medals: Kyokujitsu sho (The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays) and Shiju hosho (Medal of Honor with purple ribbon).  The Kyokujitsu sho is a hexagonal medal with gold and white rays radiating from a red sun hanging from an paulownia medal attached to a red and white ribbon.  The Shiju hosho is a circular medal of a silver wreath surrounding two kanji characters attached to a silver clasp and bar with a dark purple ribbon.  On the left, behind him, a grey table with a Bible is visible.  A white scroll with two kanji characters hangs (possibly \"bright hope\") in the upper right corner on a deep blue wall.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed, + camp Red Cross paper article \"Miss Nance Visits Poston\".  Transcription:<br>December 28, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ Thank you ever so much for the many nice presents you sent me. The candy and nuts were delicious. I am in the process of reading the two books you sent, and am enjoying them, especially \"The Tree Toad.\" The pin is very cute and looks very nice on my red sweater. I also received a lovely sweater from mom, a purse from sis, and a bath mit, hair ribbons, socks, candy, and a few other things. The giving and receiving at Christmas time is always fun, but we really missed father since my brother was here last Christmas, and there wasn't any menfolk in the house. Many other homes must have missed their menfolks, too. I hope someday soon we may all enjoy \"Peace on Earth, Goodwill Toward Men\" and that many folks may enjoy a really happy reunion. According to letters received here Yuki is spending his five day holiday at my sister's place. It gave mother and me pleasure to think that at least they were having a happy reunion. I believe Minoru Kojima went with my brother, too, as they are roommates, and their family is scattered, too. I hope by next year at least father will be able to join us. \/ Enclosed with this letter you will find a clipping about Mrs. Nance's visit to Poston. This was in the Red Cross paper which is published here, and is rather battered because the neighbors little got a hold of it before I did and managed to do some fancy scribbling which I haven't yet learned to read. \/ You may be interested in how we celebrated Christmas. Christmas eve the annual choir singing was held at the stage. The choir sang, and had a pageant. It was very nice, but not as large or well done as last year. This is due primarily to the fact that so many of the leaders have gone out. After that some went to a dance held by \"Greenbays\" a bunch of S.D. boys, while others went to private parties, or just stayed home. We went to a private party. About 10:30 we heard the Church group of about 40 boys and girls making the rounds to each block as they sang various carols. It was beautiful, and more enchanting than the choir singing. I went with them last year through the sand and storm and even later rain, but not this year. We enjoyed our party and went home. \/ Christmas Day we opened all our presents. After lunch (cabbage [called something terrible that sounds like cabbage] ugh!) Santa (alias Mr. Ouchi) came in and presented gifts to those under 17 and those above 60. These presents to the children were gifts from people back East who were good enough to give them to the children. Candies were given to children with the proceeds of the Bazaar which was held early in December. The older folks received a box of chocolate candies, also from the Bazaar. We (those between 17 and 59) consoled ourselves by telling each other \"we're either too young or too old\" which really is the truth! We're either too young (under 60) and too old (over 17!) Gee, I guess I'll have to add on a couple of 40 years to make the grade, but hope I'll be out of here by then so I could buy my own present! Christmas night we had roast chicked, which was delicious. I felt sick after eating so much so I didn't go to the Blk. 330 dance, though I wanted to go. About 11 p.m. or so there was a fire in Camp 2, which (according to unconfirmed rumor, but which seems true) started at the chicken coop and went on to an empty block (no occupants) and destroyed 6 or so buildings. These buildings were being used to store evacuee furniture, washing machines, refrigerators etc. so it was very costly. However, most people were glad that their inhabited homes were not burned because there they have all their immediate need. It was very windy that night and the whole sky was red. So ended Christmas. \/ Poston has been very unfortunate in fires. The buildings are made of wood and tar paper, and can easily burn down completely in",

I was most happy even though it was a mere thirty minutes. Because of the warm weather I was sorry I could not show Thomas to you. He is teething now and already has two bottom teeth.\/Yesterday when I arrived home from Louise's, Florence was happily reading a book. \"Miss Breed sent you one too,\" she said. I too was happy for \"Sylvia, Inc.\" is a Dodd, Mead and Company book and I am always anxious to read them. \/It is truly kind of you to send Florence and me so many interesting books. Books make the day shorter and happier for us. \/The books Miss Carter send me are now being read by Hisako Watanabe and Louise Ogawa. Louise and I are reading each other's books and certainly are enjoying them. \/Florence has learned her alphabet and at present is learning how to write. It will not be long before she will write her name.\/Please write and tell me about your Vacation Club at the Children's Department for I will be interested. \/We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. \/Sincerely yours,\/FLORNCE and Margaret Ishino\/P\/S She forgot the \"e.\" She said she was nervous.",

        "description":"Stretched and framed.  Unvarnished image  of a mother figure who holds in her proper right hand what appears to be a yellow flower that is being grasped by a smaller figure who is falling in mid-air.  The woman wears a gray robe belted with a lime green sash; her hair is greenish; her eyes are red and three-quarters view of the proper left side of her face is depicted.  She stands barefoot upon a floating lotus blossom, drifting on the sea towards the shore; her proper left hand raised with palm facing outward.  Dressed in crimson top and green pants and shoes, the smaller figure falls head first, with his arms and legs extended upwards.  His skin is a blue-gray color and his hair is the same gray as the woman's robe.  His face is shown in a three-quarter view of his proper right profile.  The artist uses a combination of muted and bright complementary colors to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The bright and muted colors balance each other and visually direct the viewer's eyes to the areas of primary importance.  The figures are placed centrally in the canvas.  The viewer's eyes are directed throughout the canvas by following the diagonal thrust of the child's figure to the vertical green sash, up the diagonal placement of the woman's hand and arm, leading to her neck and head, leading to her neck and head, back to the yellow flower and then back to the child.  The woman is standing upon a floating flower in the ocean and sea foam waves are depicted in stylized contour lines.  The painting is reminiscent of Sandro Botticelli's \"Venus\" (both figures are standing upon the ocean and drifting to shore admist the rippling of the waves and sea foam).  The child and woman are softly modeled with loose brush strokes, and the details of their hair and hands are rendered with delicate linear strokes.  The style of the painting is synchromism with its emphasis on a balance of form, rhythm and color harmony.  The painting shows the woman as a figure of dignity and strength.  She is painted in calm and muted colors and her figure is towering.  The child, on the other hand, is falling head first -- a precarious and vulnerable position.  One interpretation of the painting may be the archetype of the mother versus figure symbolizing maternal strength to keep the child from falling into a figurative sea of moral confusion. The painting could also be a metaphor for the wartime experiences of the Japanese Americans.   According to Buddhist tradition, the lotus flower is symbolic of enlightenment, supreme truth and purity emerging from impurity (it blooms unscathed from its muddy origin).  This reading substantiates the view of the artist's mother as a blessed, even reverential archetype of motherhood.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Sept. 3, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ Thank you ever so much for the iron which I received yesterday. Everyone was overwhelmed with joy when we saw the iron. I have been wondering all night how I can put in words my gratitude. And I always seem to end up by saying \"Thank You.\" I hope in the near future I will be able to show how much I appreciate everything you have done for me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank You! \/ I ironed with it last night and it works beautifully. I wanted to write you as soon as I received the iron but I thought it best to wait until I received your letter. I hope you will include every penny you spent to purchase the iron. Poston seems to be still the same hot, susty place. With the heavy rainfall we had the other week, the grounds have become a little harder, and the wild grasses seem to have grown a little thicker, to my father's disgust. \/ As I recall, you asked in your last letter if I applied for leave. Well, I have not as yet. But to my surprise, my Eastern Defense Clearance Papers came the other day. The thing that was so surprising was that I didn't even apply for it. At the present time, I am trying awfully hard to convince my father that I should go out, but he feels that I should wait a little while. He believes I am too young, in mind if not in age. But at the rate I am pestering him, he'll give in sooner or later, unless his patience holds out! I talk to him so that he says he even dreams of me talking to him of going out. I can just about imagine how he finally said yes, in his dream of course, but this doesn't satisfy me cause it was not in reality. But just you wait and see, I'll be writing soon saying \"I'm finally going out Miss Breed!\" Oh what happy days that will be. But on the other hand, the thought of leaving my father leaves me hesitant. \/ School is scheduled to commence September 20th. Everyone in the office is left very busy with registration etc. The office is still being remodeled but hope it will be finished very soon. \/ Tonight's movie is going to be \"Take A Letter, Darling.\" I am very anxious to see it since I have heard so much about it. \/ One of my girl friends relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, and she wrote and said that she just couldn't get use to the indoor theaters. In Poston the movies are shown outdoors, under the stars. She kept looking up at the ceiling thinking she would see the stars. While waiting for the movie to begin, everyone looks up at the sky trying to find the Big Dipper etc. (This is in Poston of couse.) I can imagine how much she enjoyed the picture sitting in the soft-cushioned chairs. \/ I never thought I would have friends in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Colorado, Arkansas, Utah, Idaho, or Wyoming; but I do now! \/ One of these days, I'll be traveling all over the United States just visiting friends. I think that'll be such fun! \/ September 5, 1943 \/ <br>Hello Miss Breed! \/ Well, here I am again! I thought I'd wait a few days for your letter but not a day longer, so off this letter will go. \/ I know you are very busy but I do hope you will write very soon and inform me of the amount (total) I owe you. \/ \"Take A Letter Darling\" certainly was an enjoyable comedy! It kept us laughing all through the picture. \/ Well, Miss Breed I have finally joined the Poston Indian tribe. I imagine it'll take you centuries to join this tribe! You see, the only way you can join it is to become \"black\". \/ Waaa waaa...me out of news. \/ Most respectfully, \/ Louise Ogawa \/ My best regards to Miss McNary.",

They were here Tuesday afternoon to Friday afternoon. The only people working were those in the mess division and certain sections of the maintenance and recreation department. Even U.S. Mail was at a standstill.\/What a sad surprise I received when mail was resumed. I had a letter from dad saying that he had received notice of internment for the duration. There is a chance of reopening his case. In order to do so he requires an affidavit of conduct. I am enclosing his letter. I would greatly appreciate it if you are able to see Mr. Kabler of the Pacific Coast Barber Supply. Mr. Ruben Imansky of the Bohemian Rye Bakery has known dad for a long time and he has stated that he would help in any way possible. Mr. Goldberg of The Family Rye Bakery also has had favorable words for dad.\/ Are you still receiving the Pacemaker &amp; Pacific Citizen?\/Sincerely yours,\/Ted.\/P.S.

Florence and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\/When Florence saw the book she said \"Oh boy! This is just what I wanted!\" For me, \"Don Watson Starts His Band\" was a beautiful birthday gift. Now, I may travel to different cities with Don Watson and entertain people.\/The other week I read Judy Grant: Editor, and found it a thrilling adventure solving a mystery with Judy and her friends. \/I visit our library once a week. Though it is small it is nicely arranged. There are many, many magazines from \"American\" to \"Zoological Gardens.\" I have been checking out magazines thus far, but I hope to check books soon. I wish that you could come and see our library.\/ Miss Breed, if you happen to have a discarded copy of \"Beautiful Joe,\" I certainly would appreciate it! I have read that book several times, but each time I read it I began to love Joe more and more.\/Incidently did you know Fusa moved to Barrack 36? I see her now and then with her ever congenial smile. \/<br>Here is a house Florence drew for you. She hopes you like it!\/Sincerely yours,\/FLORENCE and Margaret Ishino",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Margaret Ishino to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>September 28, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Thank you very kindly for your lovely letter and the two wonderful books you sent to Florence and me.\/ I think your stationery is truly nice because it matches and you can write longer letters to me as I am always happy to receive long letters.\/I do not know where the Indians moved but on the way mother saw a few on the bus as she came into Poston. Although I have not seen any here it certainly would be a thrill to me if I could actually see a true Indian or two.\/We are all patiently waiting for our winter clothing, but as yet they have not arrived.\/I can just picture San Diego as it now looks. I imagine the downtown's are not as crowded as before. Are you still riding theose old, old streetcars which give you the feeling that they will break down before they reach the next block?\/Uncle Sam needs every bit of rubber etc. so I would not be at least surprised to hear that you are going from place to place on bicycles or skates.\/Yes, it is hard to have friends and relatives go and to know some are not coming back. but it truly pitiful to see these tiny Japanese children grow up without their fathers as many of them have been taken. I know the whole world is praying for everlasting peace and goodwill toward men.\/I am very disappointed that we do not have a library in Poston, but I hope they will have one soon. There is no library here as I said, but we have movies here every Saturday night beneath the Arizona stars. Last Saturday we saw \"Abraham Lincoln\" with Walter Houston. I enjoyed the picture very much as Abraham Lincoln is my favorite president and one of the greatest men that ever lived. I do not know how to say this after all the wonderful books you sent me, but I would be more than pleased to receive a book about Abraham Lincoln.\/How could Louise and I ever judge you harshly after all those happy hours you have given us through your books and letters? Truly words cannot be expressed how grateful we are to you.\/ Thomas was 8 months old on the 27th. We weighed and measured him yesterday. His weight was 22 lbs., and his height was 30 inches. He can turn over now and tries to stand at every opportunity he gets. I have a feeling he is going to walk and not crawl, but I may be wrong again for he can turn completely around by himself.\/Florence seems much happier here than Santa Anita for she has her little friends whom she played with in San Diego. Her friends are over our \"apartment\" or she is over theirs. Florence and I are anxiously waiting for school which is going to start on the 5th of October. If luck is with me I have a chance working part time as a typist and going to school. Of course I will be paid for that job then I will not have to trouble my folks for for the necessities when school begins.\/Just before we left Santa Anita I asked my girl friend to buy some things for me, but in the future I will trouble you for our errands.\/Florence was so happy she asked me to help her write a letter to you. I hope you can make it out for she has written it with a pencil.\/ Please give my best regards to Miss McNary.\/Sincerely,\/Margaret IshinoSEPT. 28, 1942\/DEAR MISS BREED \/THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK. \/THE WEATHER IS STILL HOT AND DUSTY.\/PLEASE SAY \"HELLO\" TO MISS MC NARY.\/Florence",

Our roof almost came off, and every time a wind came, it shook our room. There was a whole lot of thunder and lighting.\/How did you like your visit to Santa Anita?\/I sure wish I was back there again. I hear they get ice cream + cake + watermelon. We get watermelon, but we have to pay for them. I guess everybody thinks I'm going crazy. The reason is that I am learning Pig Latin!\/You ought to hear me.\/I sure wish I brought a dairy with me. I certinly would have a lot to write. This is what I would write:\/The food is awful\/The heats terrific\/Whirlwind--dust\/ Home sich\/This is only half.

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Sept. 27,  1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I was overwhelmed with joy to hear from you. And I was very glad to hear you like the little \"geta\". I'm sorry to say they were not made from a knot. Yes, the knot-carvers are very skilled people. I was very interested to read about your doll colllection and Fusa. I can imagine how Fusa stole the show. Miss Breed, I wish you told me about your doll collection when I was in San Diego and I would have been more than happy to add something to your collection. As I remember, you often had doll exhibits in the library--were they yours?\/Thank you Miss Breed, for asking questions because it has helped me alot--for than I know this letter has something of interest to you. Now to answer them--yes, we do have chairs and tables. Father made them out of scraps of wood which we found here and there. They may not be of the best but they are substantial. We also have pillows which we brought from San Diego. But we do not have mattresses. We use some of our blankets as mattresses. In Santa Anita we were issued a spring bed and mattress but here we were just issued a cot. Many people who are skilled are making beds. They say a wooden bed is much better for your posture. The cot sinks down in the middle while the wooden bed stays straight.\/Miss Breed, it's a good thing you didn't see me eat my first meal with a knife. I would have been embarassed and you probably would have grown impatient waiting for me to finish that you would have told me to eat with my fingers. If Emily Post saw me than she would throw a fit.\/The movies are just grand. We see one every Saturday evening. It is shown outdoors. The screen is placed right in front of the oil tank and we sit (bring our own chairs) or stand and enjoy the movie. So far we have seen the following:\/ 1) There Goes My Heart--Frederick March + Virginia Bruce\/2) The Last of the Mohicans--Randolph Scott, Binnie Barnes\/3) Doomed to Die--Boris Karloff\/4) Topper Takes a Trip--Roland Young + Constance Bennett\/5)Abraham Lincoln--Walter Houston + Una Merkel\/The water and electricity is turned off on Sundays when the men work on the water pipe or while making canals etc. It has not been turned off for a long time now. The first Sunday we were here it was turned off. I'm glad it is not turned off regularly because oh, how inconvenient it would be!\/The police and the post office and fire dept. is run by Japanese Americans. As yet I have not seen any persons connected with the army. There are no fence around this camp has there was in Santa Anita.\/School has not begun yet and I do not know who the teachers are. But I shall write more fully about it after school begins. Yesterday we saw how a teacher's room is going to be furnished. There was a nice bed was a spring and mattress, nice Spanish style bedroom set, a soft chair, lamp and linoleum on the floor. I was almost tempted to sit on the soft chair, sit before the large dresser and lay on the bed.\/You may have read about the boys leaving Poston to work in Idaho and Nebraska on the farm. About 45 San Diegans went. We expect them back in a couple of months. But while there, if they find a job they can call their family and stay there. Kunio Kawamoto (twin's brother), Sammy Shimamoto, Walter Obayashi, George Watanabe (June's brother) were among the ones who left for Idaho A few more boys left for Nebraska too.\/Here's something quite interesting which I read in a very recent edition of the Pacemaker--One man who lived in Santa Anita forgot and left all the money he had, $218.00 in a money belt under his mattress and left for Heart Mt., Wyoming. One of the working men found the money while picking up beds and mattresses. Then several days later the loser wrote back for the money and requested that 10% of it be given to the man who found it. This may sound incredible but I guess when your mind is on moving you can even forget your most precious possession.\/I rece",

Indeed, you write some of the most interesting letters I ever read.\/I was surprised to hear that there were scorpions in San Diego. I never saw any or heard anything of a scorpion until I came here, but I still have to see a real live scorpion. My mother says they move very fast.\/I wonder if I told you that we gave some of the seeds away. (I mean the ones you sent me for Christmas.) I just have one left. I wanted to plant them very much, but my mother was busy and I couldn't possibly plant them by myself. However, since my mother has more time, (she quit her job.) we may be able to plant both seeds this summer.\/However, as we are planning to go out, we mine as well take them with us. We don't know as yet where we can go, but if there is a suitable job someplace, we are going. That is why mother quit her job as head waitress and stewardess. \/School is fine, but my grade is dropping. It is hard to work in this warm weather.\/Going back to the seeds again, they bloomed nicely they were very beautiful. I hear that this was the only block that has such beautiful flowers. Again I thank you for them.\/The soil is not rich enough. If we stay here, we are going to try to plant the seeds though.\/Lately we've been getting a lot of candy. For instance we have four pinwheels, three cents worth of candy with jelly inside, (I ate around two cents worth in one day.) Some really small candy, Boston baked beans, butterscotch, chocolates, and one Walnetto.\/The weathers been pretty cool for the last couple of days. I hear Wyoming had a little snowfall.\/I certinly do gip myself a lot. I spent 79 c. on a pen so that I don't have to use my mother's. I used just once or twice, and it doesn't work now, so here I am, still using my mother's pen.\/Love,\/Katherine Tasaki\/P.S.\/Am looking forward to your visit, and hoping it may be a long one.\/P.S. I met up with a lot of acciedents today. I was playing baseball and hurt my finger. I was walking on the steps on my bare feet, and I got a big splinter in my big toe.\/P.S. Since our room is partitioned, we have to add 1 to our address.<br>",

Transcription:<br>December 25, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Jack was very happy when he received the present you sent him. You made his Christmas a happy one and I am glad too. Maybe one of these days he will make an attempt to write you a letter. I am writing this letter to thank you for all you have done in the way of making Jack happy.\/In a camp like this there is not very much a child can do to enjoy himself. Jack has no games to play with so you can see how happy you have made him by sending him all those lovely books. We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\/Some of my girl friends like Louise, Margaret, etc. were talking about receiving presents from you too. They seemed very happy too. Louise was saying she has received quite a few books and she said she would lend me a book since I do not have any. I wonder if it would be too much to ask if I were to ask you to send me any old discarded book you might have at the library. I would appreciate it very much if you would do this for me and I would be grateful to you. The reason I ask this is because my Christmas this year was really awful. I didn't receive a single thing and I thought if you could send me an old discarded book of any kind I would have something to show as being a present from someone. I don't want to put you to any trouble and I do want you to know I appreciate all you have done for the many Japanese children. Thanking you again and hoping to hear from you soon.\/Sincerely yours,<br>Hisako Watanabe \/(Jack's sister)\/[card]\/HAPPY NEW YEAR\/Ringing in with best of wishes,\/Chiming in with greetings gay,\/So you'll know you're not forgotten\/On this happy New Year's Day!\/Yours sincerely,\/Hisako Watanabe\/I hope you still remember me.",

Transcription:<br>December 9, 1943 \/ Poston, Arizona \/ 325-13A \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ I am ashamed of myself for not writing to you sooner. So many events have occurred since I last wrote to you--I don't know where to begin. \/ Before I go into all the happenings here in Poston, how has everything been with you? I sincerely hope you have been enjoying the best of health and happiness. We have all been well and are still working at our various. \/ To begin with, both Shizuye and I are married now. Both of our husbands are from Central California. Shizuye's hails from Reedley and mine is from Ivanhoe, California. We are living in adjacent blocks so that makes visiting a very simple matter. The family lives only three blocks away so that helps a lot. \/ I am very fortunate to find myself living in the same block where the Camp III Public Library is situated. The library always was a popular spot back home and here is no exception. Students pack the tables at night--catching up on their reference work for school. \/ Please take care of yourself and best regards from us all. \/ Sincerely, \/ Yoshiko KiharaGreetings \/ Just saying \"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" \/ But that phrase is one that brings \/ A million MORE good wishes \/ For the BEST of LIFE'S GOOD THINGS! \/ Sincerely, \/ Mr. and Mrs. Shuyo Kihara",

Visible from the neck up, the woman is turned three-quarters view of the proper right side of her face and looks toward the right edge.  Young and attractivve, she wears a bright lime hair band with flowers tucked underneath and what appears to be a corsage on her lapel.<br>The artist uses a pallete of muted complementary colors, primarily reds (as coral and rose) and greens (as lime, sage and sea foam green).  The usage of these colors side by side serve to brighten their hues and give the painting a luminosity and brightness.  The bust of the woman is centrally placed in the canvas, and the image is cropped at the top of her head.  The shading is softly modeled, and the fine details of the woman's hair, brows, eyes, lips, nose and ears are rendered in precise and elegant contour lines.  The hair in particular has a grace and rhythmic quality in its fluid lines.  The style of the painting is influenced by synchronism and is similar to Hideo Date's portraits; both depict graceful and solid women using a balance of form, rhythm and color harmony to attract and excite the viewer.  The woman depicted is young, lovely and full of vitality.  The flowers in her hair and boom emphasize the freshness of youth.  The glow of light on her face seems to reflect an inner glow in her character.  Although the artist successfully depicts a woman who is beautiful and youthful, he also reveals her inner side through her expression and posture -- intelligent, thoughtful and strong.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>322-14-D\/Poston, Arizona\/June 10, 1944\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Six years ago today I graduated from San Diego High School--Tonight the first graduating class of Parker Valley High School marched into the partially constructed school auditorium and received their diplomas. They looked splendid in their caps and gowns. The boys were in blue and the girls, in white. Incidently that is the school color combination.\/Through the wonderful efforts of Poston III's school principal, Miss Cushman, and the faculty, Poston III High School this spring became an accredited high school and the name was changed to Parker Valley High School. Poston I and II High Schools are as yet unaccredited. If I am not mistaken I believe Parker Valley High School is the only relocation center high school that has been so honored.\/It is magnificent the way the students have striven for higher education. The first year here found them in make-shift barrack classrooms. When construction of the school began the whole community volunteered in making adobe bricks for the school buildings. Even school children helped so that school could open in time for the fall semester of 1943-1944. Yes, the students can rightfully be proud to say \"It's my school\" for they built it with sweat and toil during the hot summer days that Poston is noted for.\/--Just a few rambling comments on the graduation ceremony. The class gift was a beautiful American flag. Instead of a vocal selection there was a piano solo by Elain Hibi a very talented pianist from San Diego. I believe this is the first American high school graduation ceremony to have a Buddhist blessing. The class moot: The past, forever gone; the future still our own. There were nine honor students. I didn't get all their names but I did catch one and the name is Aiko Kubo (remember her?)\/-------------------\/I had hoped to be a barber at Camp Savage, Minn. The offer came to me during the last of February. In a routine checking of the arm, the doctor advised me that the arm bone is in a rather dubious state and that it would take some time before the condition would clear up. I could have walked under a snake's belly, I felt so low. Plans for leaving the first part of March were knocked into a cocked hat. That blow hit me pretty hard. I just existed from day to day. Even now I can't remember just what I did. The days seemed all the same. In May I had another consultation and the doctor advised me that it would be several more months before they could be definite on the arm. Yes ma'am I really began to feel sorry for myself but bad. Then I read some articles in the Pacific Citizen, the JACL newspaper. It told of the heroic deeds of the nisei soldiers, of the hardships they suffered.---I woke up. What I am going thru is nothing compared to the fighting man on the front.\/I am back in training now. I am taking weight-lifting to condition my body. Exercise seems to do my arm more good than resting it all the time. I have started playing golf. The arm is a handicap but after all there are one armed golfers who do all right, besides I have fun. I am trying to learn how to play bridge, too. Just now with all the exercising and music lessons (I am still trying to play a guitar) I am kept pretty busy after work. It certainly helps to keep my mind off the fact that I can't relocate just yet. Time seems to fly right by. I received quite a jolt when I realized that it won't be long before 1944 is half over. \/The days are getting very hot now. The winds blow much more this year than last. They help to keep the days bearable.\/How did San Diego take the news of the invasion? I didn't know about it for two days--at that I thought it was a rumor around camp. You see I hadn't seen a newspaper in weeks and our radio doesn't work until the early hours of the morning at which time I am usually asleep. Most of the people here in camp were like me--we just didn't know abou",

Transcription:<br>Sept. 16, 1942 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ I have received your post card and I was indeed happy to hear from you. I also received the candies and the lock and keys. They were just what mother wanted. Thank you ever so much. We enjoyed the candies tremendously. Thank you a million times more. Now to get down to business. What was the price of the lock and keys including the tax etc.? Now there is a post office here so I will be able to send the amount to you by money order. I sincerely hope I did not cause you too much trouble. \/ I hope I did not give you the wrong impression of Poston! This is a wonderful place--way out in the open spaces. It would be paradise if it were not for the dust, heat, and the insects. The dust here seems to be very well known. The heat is very hot. Even though it is September it gives me the feeling of July. \/ Miss Breed, I have been roasting for the past few weeks. Now I am ready to be set on the table and be carved. Miss Breed, I'll bet you a hundred dollars that you won't be able to beat my tan!! \/ Yesterday, Sept. 15, the temperature was 127 outside and 115 inside. I knew it was very hot but not knowing how high the temperature was, I washed and ironed after coming home from work (2:00--3:30 the hotest time of the afternoon.) As I sit writing this letter, a little creek has formed in the back of my leg. \/ The San Diego crickets were harmless but very noisey in the evening. But the Poston crickets are very naughty. It eats clothing. I guess, San Diego has the best of everything! The other day I sprinkled my clothes to iron--before I knew it a cricket had made a nice big hole in the back of my skirt. It's just no use sprinkling your clothes because while ironing one shirt all the other sprinkled clothes become dry. So the heat is terrific here. I wonder how it will be when winter rolls around. I may have complained about my new environment but I know it will be difficult to adapt myself to the new surroundings right away. I am sure everything will brighten up soon and in a few more weeks I will begin to love this place almost as much as my home in San Diego. When I stop to think  how the pilgrims started their life, similar to ours, it makes me feel grand for it gives me the feeling of being a pure full-blooded American. \/ School is going to begin October 5th. Many California teachers are coming here to teach us. Our principal is Mr. Potts. Have you ever heard of him? I was just wondering whether he was from California. I am glad I will be able to finish high school. I imagine the San Diego City Schools will open soon. \/ The other day we had fresh pears for dinner. It was my first pear in five months. It certainly was delicious!! \/ Since the Colorado River is three miles from here many boys and girls go swimming and fishing. It certainly is a nice long walk! As yet I have not gone but I hope to soon. If you swim to the other side of the river you are in California, but it is very hard to do because of the strong current. About three boys from Camp 1 and 2 have drowned. \/ I must get this in this morning's mail so I'll say good bye until I hear from you. I hope you will always be in the best of health. \/ Most sincerely, \/ Louise Ogawa \/ Please give my best to Miss McNary. I heard she was trying to beat Margaret's tan and I can imagine what a hard thing that is to do. Miss Breed, I would love to have a picture of you and Miss McNary!!!!!",

I liked the book very much. We play all kinds of games in the playground. There is a recreation school for children from 5 to 11. I am 10 yrs. old, but I don't want to go, so I stay at home and play. Last night there was a picture show. There were 2 comic pictures, sports, sports in Africa, and a picture titled \"The Gangs All Here.\" It was a gangster picture. There has been baseball games going on at one of the training tracks. San Diego won several times. My cousin Helen is working in the canteen, and day before yesterday she gave me a dime. She is very nice, and I wish you could meet her. You should have seen all the nice things Miss Fay sent me. She sent me a ball, some candy, a cute little boat, some nice cards, a 10 c. defense book, (with a stamp in it) and Fuzzy Wuzzy. Last week a friend sent me 2 funny books, and I still haven't read all of them yet, because everybody looks at it. Mother says \"Hello.\" Say \"Hello\" to everybody for me.\/Sincerely,\/Katherine Tasaki",

        "description":"Stretched and framed .  Image of a nude man sitting upon an open-roofed structure, bent over in grief, next to a black bird.  The structure is cement colored and blackish, with walls and doors giving it a maze-like appearance.  In the background, a purple mountain looms above the horizon and the sun (or full moon) is obscured by dark clouds.  The painting is rendered in earth tones--muted hues of gray, putty, taupe and maize.  The sky is a shade of pale sea green.  The figure of the man is softly modeled and his proportions are exaggerated to emphasize his muscles and broad shoulders.  He is centrally placed in the foreground, and his bulk dominates the bottom the canvas.  The shape of the blackbird is simplified and solid.  The form of the building structure, painted diagonally lends a quality of dynamism into the scene.  Barely perceptible by the wall of the building and painted the same shade of earth as the ground is a shadowy ghostlike face or the suggestion of a skull.  The eerie light (whether it's from the sun or moon) provides an atmosphere of mysteriousness and foreboding.  The painting is styled in a surreal manner, creating an alternate world with highly symbolic imagery and meaning.  The frame is painted khaki.  While it is not obvious whether the artist painted this during or post World War II, it is apparent that it depicts a Japanese-American concentration camp.  The tilted plateau mesa of Heart Mountain (where the artist and his family were imprisoned) figures predominantly in the background.  The fact that sun (or moon) is obscured by dark clouds is symbolic of both the psychological darkness experienced by the artist at being locked away because of his race, and the darkness of the times, in which paranoia and xenophobia dominated the American psyche.  The male figure is holding what appears to be an eyeball, which may be symbolic of the government's desire to keep the Japanese Americans \"in the dark\" about the social injustice of their imprisonment. The building structure, representing the barracks at Heart Mountain, is reminiscent of a maze or labyrinth, emphasizing the sense of entrapment.  Two figures are the focal point of the painting:  the naked man and the blackbird.  Stripped of his clothes, his self respect, and his dignity, the man unashamedly weeps.  The blackbird is an ambiguous symbol.  In the Japanese tradition, the bird represents a messenger of the gods.  In the Western tradition, notably in Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven, the blackbird is a symbol of foreboding and ominous tidings.  The sense of doom is reinforced by the ghostly skull.  Overall, the painting is emotionally powerful.  Through symbolic imagery, the artist strongly depicts a shameful chapter in American history.",

It certainly is an interesting one! Last night I couldn't stop reading and mother had to tell me to turn off the light. The lights have to be off by 10:00 P.M. and oh, how I wished it could be on until I finished it. I sometimes wish I could experience what Molly did.  And how thrilling that would be. I think the pictures are just lovely. They've impressed me very much.\/I wish I could express my gratitude in another way besides saying \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" Maybe in the near future I will be able to show you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me. Thank you!\/We are going to be given clothing--today we handed in our order. I am allowed $2.85 a month. We are allowed to order just certain things from the Sears catalog. I think we are very fortunate to be given clothing and free coupon books.\/The weather here is very unpredictable. It was either Monday or Tuesday (Aug. 10-11)--for weeks and weeks it was extremely hot then all of a sudden the next day it began to pour. But the next day it was again very hot.\/I am working on a three shift right now. This means I work morning, noon, and night.--8 hrs. a day. This does not give me much time to do anything. I go washing in the evening after work and do my ironing and corresponding at that time too. I should have written to you sooner but I hope you will accept my apologies.\/Please give my best to Miss McNary and thanks a million times more for the book!\/Most sincerely,\/Louise Ogawa\/Aug.    , 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/The time has come again for me to say \"good-bye\" until I hear from you again at my new home. I intended to write to you sooner thanking you for the mdse. I ordered. I received it with great satisfaction. Thank you ever so much. My friends advised me to delay my letter writing because in a few days the notices to leave will come--and as said, it has come. We, San Diegans, are going to leave Santa Anita for Parker, Arizona on Wednesday or Thursday. (Aug. 26, 27) We are going in two groups - one on Wed. the other on Thursday.\/It seems that we are going further and further away from San Diego but I hope to be back soon. I never have gone to Arizona and so I am sure it will be a new adventure to me. We are again leaving by train right after our supper--Wed. The camp is in an up roar just talking about evacuation. Today is my last day at work for I must wash, iron, and pack. It reminds me of the day when I left San Diego.\/I hope you will write often. Since I'll be far far away from home I will be more than happy to hear from you.\/My friend has made a pair of \"geta\" which I am sending you. I hope you will enjoy it. The so called shallac (glossiness) is fingernail polish.\/I must close now for I want to mail this and the package to you as soon as possible.\/Most sincerely,\/Louise Ogawa\/Ps. I shall write the first thing after reaching my destination--Colorado River Relocation Project-. in Arizona.\/The best of luck to you always!",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D\/Poston, Arizona\/October 9, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/ This is the first chance I have had to thank you for sending me the dictionary and also they book \"The Person You Want to Be.\" I certainly do want to thank you for sending me both of them. The book you sent me certainly is essential here because we have a tendency to get \"sloppy\" and not care about our appearance any more. It certainly is worth reading and trying out some of the things taught in the book.\/Right now I am working in the Construction Office as a so called Secretary. Gee, I really don't work hard at all. My boss is in Camp #1 most of the time and comes her about once a day. Our job here is to keep the time of the Carpenters and to make requisitions. If anyone needs tables, chairs, or benches, we make out the requisitions and send them to the Carpenter Shop. Right now the shop is busy making tables for the schools. The greatest difficulty is getting the supplies. We really are short on lumber and nails.\/About two nights ago we had an electrical storm. This was our first experience in a storm here. All day clouds formed in the sky. About dusk the clouds were really grey making the place seem dark. Then the winds began to blow. The dust just whirled and began to dance around like a \"jitterbug.\" The wind started to howl almost as loud as the coyotes at night. Then, lightening, then of course, thunder. Then, rain! We were all inside the house, but we were well aware that our top roofs were threatening to blow off. Our stove pipe hole, (which has yet to be filled with a pipe) began to let in the torrent of rain and dirt. We had to move our belonging from there. After that, we were all comfortable and tried to forget the rain. That was rather exciting and quite a change from the usual sun shine and dust flying all over.\/ A few days ago we were given hay for our mattresses. We did not like the idea at first because we had heard that there are bugs, etc. which could possibly breed in them. However, they are not as bad as we expected. The only thing wrong is that they sag in company with the body and stay that way. We have to reshape our mattresses every night. The hay certainly keeps us much warmer than we thought possible.\/Last Monday school started. We watched all the students taking their own chairs to school and regretted the fact that we had already gotten out of school. There are about 20 Caucasian teachers in Camp 3. They certainly represent a variety of states. There are some from Oklahoma, New York, Virginia, and California. Most of the teachers are rather on the old side. There is one male teacher who lives in a trailer. All the students who have him tell me that he wears a wig. They claim that they can see the stitching on his wig. I don't know how true that is, but it sounds just like a rumor we used to hear about a teacher in junior high school.\/ Next week evening shorthand classes begin. I am planning to attend and really make use of Miss McNary's Shorthand Book. At the present time one of the secretaries is using it, and brushing up on her shorthand----she has to take down every word spoken at certain meetings and is relearning the brief forms.\/My sister arrived in Colorado (Amache branch of Lamar). Over there the facilities are yet very incomplete. Their houses are built much more substantially and they have brick floors and a stove in each unit. They said that they had a very enjoyable train ride with really good food on the train. All the letters I received tell me that the worst scenery was, of course, in Arizona. All they saw was miles and miles of desert country. Gee, as if we didn't know it!\/Friends in Wyoming tell  me that it is dusty and cold there, but they have stoves and can have as much coal as they want. We heard that Arkansas wasn't bad at all! Gee, everyone was saying that Arizona and Arkansas would be the worst. People in Arkansas say that there are trees and",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 25, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Thanks a million for everything: the nice letter you sent me, the pictures, and the book. I certainly was glad to receive all of them.\/I gave Mrs. Araki the picture and she was very grateful. She said that she was going to send that picture to her husband, who has been interned. She would certainly appreciate it if you would send another copy for her to keep. She said to tell you thanks a lot!\/My mother gave the other pictures to Yuriko and Mariko. I believe that they will write or have written to you already. Thank you for sending me \"Judy Grant, Editor.\" At the present time I am about half way through the book. I promised to lend it to another girl who wants to read it. I will pass it around, and as soon as they are through I will return it to you.\/Let me describe Santa Anita to you. It is located on a huge tract of land covering I guess about 75 to 100 acres. There are just rows and rows of houses. Families usually live in two rooms. If there are six or more in a family, they get four rooms. At the present time all the families live in what were formerly horse's stables. They all have new doors and windows in the front of the houses and the floors have been covered with asphalt. A partition separates the various families. We can overhear out neighbor's conversations even though we don't want to. One thing different from the ordinary home is the large door on the inside. The huge door is cut in half and is similar to those that the Dutch people have. These were made so that horses could stick out their head.\/The mess hall is located where the grandstand used to be, and where all the bets were placed. It is a huge place and very well constructed. I believe that must be about the only thing that was really well constructed. We have very good food to eat. The quality of the cooked food is getting better, too. You've noticed that I said \"cooked food\" because the food itself is almost the best. For example today for lunch we had: roast beef and boiled potatoes with gravy, spinach, and cole slaw. However, there are two things that bother me:\/1. We don't get a second helping.<br>2. If the noon meal is very good, supper is terrible!\/Gee, but really, I'm thankful for getting food free and also housing.\/My sister will arrive in Santa Anita on the 30th or the first of next month. We were certainly glad to read that the people in her locality were coming here instead of going directly to Manzanar.\/I guess I could ramble on and on and you'd probably be bored to death so I guess I'd better stop.\/Thank you for sending everything. Your card was so pretty that I have pinned it up in room.\/Truly,\/Fusa Tsumagari\/P.S. A library has been started here. As soon as it opens I will tell you all about it. Yours, Fusa",

Transcription:<br>February 27, 1944\/Dear Miss Breed, \/I do not know just how to begin to tell you how sorry I am about my long silence. It seems after my sister's marriage, I have neglected my correspondance for at this moment I am enjoying quite a headache trying to catch up on it. \/I was indeed happy to hear from you and was extremely pleased to hear you like the little Xmas gift. I do not know who made it, but I do know it is made out of mesquite.\/Well, I hope today is the last of the heavy rainfall we have been having. I understand California is having its share too. Here is Poston it has been raining continuously for almost one week. I love the rain except for the muddy ground. The schools were closed for two days because of the muddy grounds. The children certainly were happy about that! I hope we will have nice sunny weather soon though I do dread the hot summer months that are ahead. \/Yes, the swimming pool is now completed and is filled with water. I imagine that will be the most favorite spot for all when June, July, August rolls around. \/The adobe school is completed too except for the auditorium. At present Miss Cushman is trying awfully hard to have each department with their complete equipments so the school can be accredited through the Arizona State Education Dept.\/I think the Education Dept. is the most busiest place in Poston. We always seem to find loads of work to do, but I know that is very excellent experience for us. I know my experiences here will be of great aid to me in the future. \/My sister is now living in St. Paul, Minnesota. Yes, for me it will be difficult to step into the life outside since I am yet quite young, but I would like to take a stab at it. I hope someday soon I will be able to do so.\/ This year the seniors were very fortunate to have their pictures taken. Through the courtesy of the photographer, I was lucky enough to have mine taken too. At present I am waiting its arrive.\/The most common topic of conversation today seems to concern the reclassification draft situation. Most of the parents are very much concerned. Since the moral of the camp is low I sometimes wonder what the opinion of the boys are. \/I do hope Miss Plaister is well on the road to recovery!! I can understand how it is when someone so essential is sick because we often sit at our desks wishing Miss Cushman was there when she isn't.\/I hope everything is fine with you, Miss Breed! Do take good care of yourself and please give my regards to Miss McNary.\/Most respectfully,\/Louise Ogawa",

They certainly will come in handy. \/ The weather was very hot Wed. + Thurs--so hot even to stay inside the house. Saturday and Sunday have been cool weather for a change--rained a little. \/ Last Saturday, May 16, several of the teachers from State College came inside the gate to see us. They were Dr. Dotson, registrar, Dean Peterson, Miss I. Hammock, Miss Shafer and Mrs. Obsurn. Certainly were glad to see them. \/ I wish you could come inside the gate with Miss Fay and see our Santa Anita Library. It has been growing by leaps and bounds. Thanks to donations. \/ Sincerely--Margaret.<br>",

I am saving it for Christmas so I can have the thrill of opening it on that day. \/ The big news here is the lifting of the mass exclusion act for persons of Japanese Ancestry. Everything for leave processing has not been clarified as yet. All this rather has me all up in the air. I haven't been able to think much about it. The suddenness and the magnitude of the problem took me by surprise. \/ Christmas here in Poston will be one of Thanksgiving. However there are many who look with misgiving toward the new year with the prospect of the closing of the centers next year. They have nothing to start anew on the outside. \/ I am sending you some cigarettes as we have just about nothing else this year suitable for gifts. I am sure you can find someone who could make use of them. Cigarettes are rationed here at 1 pkg per person per day. \/ A Merry Christmas to you and your mother from dad and me. \/ Sincerely \/ Ted.",

I really liked the book, but I couldn't find time to write because my works in the kitchen as a head waitress. \/We are having an Exhibit at our fire station. It shows the work of the Poston I Elementry School pupils. I meant to make a baby's kimono, but I didn't have time to finish. anyway, they are going to sell my towel I knitted for the Red Cross a long time ago.\/My classmates gave me a birthday party for me on my birthday which was April 9. It was loads of fun.\/My mother bought me a dress and a sewing set and stockings for my birthday. For her birthday I made her a card. I bought her a box of hankies for Easter.\/Today I went to the canteen and bought myself a pen. The upper part of this letter is written by my mother's pen. The lower part is written by my new pen.\/We have much more nicer books at our library now. A few of the books I have already read at your library. \/Yaeko came to visit me recently. She isn't changed much from the last time I saw her.\/I got my report card a few days ago. It had all \"s's.\" I think I explained in one of my letters what it meant. If I didn't, is means \"satisfactory.\"\/Thank you again for the book.\/Love,\/Katherine Tasaki",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D \/ Poston, Arizona \/ September 27, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ This letter certainly is far overdue, isn't it? I'll have to make myself write oftener. The hardest part of the letter is getting started--after that there's just too much to say. \/ Saturday night we had a lightning and thunderstorm and the lights went out completely about 8 p.m. By then it was pitch dark except for occasional flashes of lightning. Most people told me they were terrified--but I wasn't. I just pretended that I was camping somewhere (near S.D., of course) and that it had begun to thunder and rain. Of course, our home made me thinking of camping because of the background--cot beds, the rough interior of the house, and crude furniture. I had fun in my imagination and soon went off into a dreamless sleep. \/ The next morning was extremely cold and a little cloudy, but now it's almost clear. The weather indicates an early winter, I think. We are all wearing sweaters for the first time in some months. We make fun of each other calling: \"sweater girl\" cause they're still rather odd after a hot season. \/ Yesterday I finished reading \"Lost Horizon.\" It really left me with a funny feeling. I was continually amazed by its similarity to this place called Poston. The oddities such as retarding ones growing old, and not being able to breathe easily or rapidly etc. do not apply here. The points that interested me were: (1) the isolation (2) doing everything in moderation (3) the feeling of wanting to go out, and on the other hand, wanting to stay in this leisurely place. \/ We really have a feeling of isolation here. Of course we have contact with the outside world daily--the newspapers, radio, Sears orders, and mail. Yet, we do not feel the pinch of war acutely nor do we feel it directly. The war is watched yet, we don't feel a part of it--we feel isolated. \/ Everything is done in moderation as in Shangri-la. Take for example our food--not too good not too poor. Moderation! Or would you call that mediocrity? Nothing here is directly on schedule. If you want something you just have to wait for it, and in due time you will get it. We very rarely feel rushed to do anything except perhaps to catch the bus which leaves every hour for camp 1. \/ Some feel, as Mallinson in the story, the strong urge to get out--to do things--anything to get out of here. Others, the more aged perhaps, feel strongly that they have no desire to get out. All their lives they've worked hard--and now they are granted food, shelter, and clothing allowance free. They have to work to be entitled to get the clothing allowance, but they work in moderation. I guess this place could be called a second Shangri-la--if you like this type of living. \/ This book would not have impressed me so strongly if I had read it a few years ago--but now I am continually amazed at the similarity of the two places. Maybe it's my imagination--I don't know. Enough of this kind of talk. \/ Also read \"Exchange Ship\" by Max Hill about the people (Americans) who were in Japan at the outbreak of war--how they became prisoners, their stay in prison and later their return to America via Asama and Gripsholm as exchange prisoners of war. It was very interesting and we know how they felt and how they were treated. It mention a Miss Alice Grube, who is now working in the Welfare Dept. here. \/ Have been doing a little bit of crocheting, needlepoint, and knitting besides reading. Been getting tired of this routine and feeling rather bored. Everybody hits these moods sooner or later. \/ Have to go home now (am writing this in the office) so I will close now. \/ Please give my best regards to your mother and also Miss McNary. \/ Always, \/ Fusa \/ Sept. 29, 1943 \/ This letter is still in my box so I'll really have to send it today. \/ Yesterday I went to camp 1 to see some of the catalogues of approved schools at the student relocation office.

Transcription:<br>March 5, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Mcnary, \/ I know you have been expecting a letter from me long before this. I am sure you think I am ungreatful. But I like the yarn very much. There is nothing I like better than to knit my head off. \/ I made little blocks from each color and peiced them together and made a blanket for the dolls. Now my mother is showing me how to knit a dolls sweater. \/ I'm sorry my writting is so bad, (It's bad enough as it was) but didn't get to write for almost a week because I have the chicken poxs. \/ Everybody was getting them so I guess it's my turn now. \/ Now that our room is partitioned, it is easier to keep clean. It is very cozy and I like it better. \/ <br>I am very sorry to hear that transportation is so slow now. But at least you have some means of travel (not feet) but out here we don't have so much as a mule! (Though we have a few horses and cows.) The horses belong to the Indians and cows wouldn't be very much help. \/ At our school we don't have very much plays, except for a few speciel occaisens. Fore instance at Chirstmas each person holds a card with a letter on it. When each person is in the right place it it supposed to spell \"Merry Chirstmas.\" Besides that each person must learn a poem to represent his letter. Mine was the last \"a\" in Chirstm@s. The poem was: \/ Apples in the stockings toe \/ Don't care much for apples though. \/ At New Years it was the same thing. I was the last letter in \"Year.\" The poem was: \/ Resolve that we will help our parents and olders without a jerk! \/ \"Jerk\" is supposed to rhyme with lurk. Another person has that poem. \/ My writting is getting worse so I better close. \/ Thank you again. \/ Yours Truly, \/ Katherine Tasaki \/ (over) \/ P.S.  \/ Thank you every so much for the paper doll. I play with it every day. And you probably know every girl likes to play with them.",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D \/ Poston, Ariz. \/ May 3, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ According to Tets, you have been trying to come to Poston, and have been having to go through a lot of red tape. If that is true, I'd like to help you get here without so much bother. I understand that if we put in an application for you, you can come in any time. If you would let me know the date you would like to come, I could try to arrange it for you. You haven't given up trying to come have you? One thing you should prepare for, in the event that you come, is the HEAT! We've been hitting over 100 in the house for the last two weeks. It certainly makes one rush around early in the morning, and then \"take it easy\" all afternoon. It's almost impossible to do anything but sleep in the afternoon. \/ I have been trying to get some things through various catalogues, but it seems as though the only way we can get certain items is to go shopping on the spot. I wonder if you could get two things for us. One is an umbrella for me. Any dark shade will do, my first choice is blue print, my second brown. I believe they cost about $2.00. The other is a gallon thermos jug, costing about $2.50. I would prefer it to have a spigot or faucet, but if there aren't any, any kind will do. Enclosed is $5 which should cover the cost. We hope it isn't too much trouble for you, but as it is impossible for us to go right into town, we certainly would appreciate your getting them for us. \/ My sister has gone out to Minneapolis to work, with her husband. He is doing farm work and she is taking care of some twins. They don't like the work too well, but are going to stick it out for a while until something better turns up. \/ Tomorrow more of my friends are leaving for Chicago for work of some kind. This leaves me with an empty feeling of wanting to go outside, yet without a definite place to go. It's really tough on people my age who have just gotten out of high school without any specific training. We want to go out and work, but we haven't had enough training or experience and feel rather unsure of ourselves. However, I guess everyone feels this way when they grow up and have to face the world. Our problems are just like anyone else except for the fact that we have to get out of camp first of all. That's more and more red tape just to get out. Everyday we see ads for work outside. Lots of girls take domestic work just to get outside, then they plan to move into some other line of work. I, myself, don't like domestic work and have been told that it isn't the best line of work to go into, even as a starter. I can amble on and on on this subject but it won't get us anywhere so this is enough of my troubles. \/ You people must be having a terrible time with all this point system and rationing. We really don't have the slightest idea about it because it doesn't affect us directly. All of it is handled through various other channels. \/ Please give your mother and Miss McNary our best regards. Please tell Miss McNary that I mean to write to her, but my correspondence is so terrible that I'm just swamped with unanswered letters all the time. \/ Thanks ever so much for the trouble of getting those things for me. \/ Sincerely, \/ Fusa",

Transcription:<br>December 22, 1943\/Dear Miss Breed,\/We received your packages today and we were all very glad to receive them.\/I can not tell you how much we appreciate all you have done to make our life here pleasant. I wish we could send you something worthwhile but it is very hard to get anything.\/My parents seemed even more over-joyed than we were to see all the gifts you had sent us. In times like this, it really makes one feel good to know he has a friend.\/Jack was very happy when he saw the book and he has started reading it already. My other brothers and I were also speechless upon seeing the presents. \/Candy is another thing which is hard to get. We all appreciated the candy, gum, and books and wish we could do something to make your Christmas just as pleasant as you have made ours.\/As you have probably heard many people are leaving camp to go to work or school. I have been wanting to relocate also and I have hopes of going out maybe by the first of the year. At any rate, I will continue to correspond with you.\/My, how thoughtless of me. I have been talking about myself and I haven't even asked you anything about yourself. How are you and how is your work coming along? I believe you are get quite busy.\/By the way, how is the little city of San Diego? I suppose there are a lot of people and housing conditions are probably very bad.\/Do you know just about how much it would cost to buy a nice box coat (beige)? Also the price of a two-piece suit? You see, the reason I am inquiring is because I want to get a coat and suit depending upon the price. If it costs too much I will have to save a little more money.\/How is the weather there? Here in Poston it is very cold in the mornings and nights and warm in the afternoons. We had a little rain about two days ago.\/Our school this year is very nice. The adobe rooms are warm in winter and cool in the summer. The children enjoy school more and they are really interested. My brother really studies hard this year. \/Do you have a discarded dictionary that you might be able to send me. I would like to have one and thought maybe you might have an old discarded one that I could use.\/Since it is getting quite late, I will close but before closing please let me thank you again for all the nice presents. We all appreciate it very much.\/Yours sincerely,\/Hisako Watanabe\/P.S. Please write real soon. I always enjoy hearing from you.<br>",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 27, 1943\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Tardily as usual I want to thank you very much for the most interesting book. I read the book in two hours. Once I started I could not stop reading it. Oh, I enjoyed it more than words can express.\/Today I am sitting at home writing letters instead of going to school. Now Miss Breed, please don't come to a conclusion until you hear my explanation. Since Saturday Poston has been having rainy weather. Today it is pouring cats and dogs. Because of the ground we are unable to attend school.\/The soil of Poston is very peculiar. When it rains, about an inch of the soil dampens. When you walk on it, the inch of mud clings to your shoe. As you lift your foot, you can see the dry sand underneath. Because the ground does not absorb the water we have a lake surrounding us.--all the water is floating on top of the mud. This may sound strange but it is a fact.\/On days like this I catch up on my  or mending. Often I sit listening to the rain as it hits against the roof.\/I have heard there was a fire at the Buddhist Temple. Was it a very big fire? Do you know how bad the damages were? We have been quite worried because all our belongings which we left behind, we left or stored it at the Buddhist Church. I certainly hope the damages were not too severe.\/We stored there such things as the World Book Encyclopedia, trunks, little of our furniture, other books, my Japanese kimono, a box of Japanese canned food which we planned to bring but was not able. If you know if all the things stored there were burned or not - I would appreciate it if will inform me. Father is quite worried.\/January 19th I attended the memorable \"ground breaking\" ceremony. At this time Mr. Head, project director of Poston; Mr. Burge, director of Camp III; Dr. Carey, superintendent of Poston schools; Mr. Potts, principal of Poston III High School drove the steak into the ground where the new school is going to be built.

I dropped a glass, and when I was picking up the pieces, a got a deep cut. Tell Miss McNary \"thank you\" for the candy.\/Since the weather is getting cooler, every body is cathing a cold. I had one, and now I caught another one. I have lots of fun with my girl friend. We play dolls and hospital. She has a very nice doll buggy. I have a nice one, but I left it at home. \/We were playing with a girl, and haveing a nice time, but she was a half, and so she went back to Pheonix. \/After Camp 3 is settled, we might go there. I don't know if I want to go or not. I have made two nice friends here, and I hate to leave them. But maybe it's better, because our room is so big, it will be hard to keep it warm. But in #3, they have petitions.\/I mustn't forget to tell you about our crocheting circle. Mamma was crochheting a scarf, and kinted a sweater so now all the women on this block are either kintting or crocheting\/Thats all for now.\/Yours Truly,\/Katherine Tasaki",

I was most happy to hear from you.\/I am sorry I took so much of your time, but since you sent me so many pencils I feel I do not need a pencil pouch. Thank you again.\/Thomas looks like Henry, my brother who is 2 years younger than I. He eats practically everything but he makes sure of what he eats. I once gave him a piece of lemon and ever since then he will not eat anything unless he is sure. He can say mama, poppa, water, sleep, and please. Our floors have holes in them and ever so often I catch him putting pencils, spoons down the holes. The other day I caught him just in time as he was going to put my pen down into the hole. He certainly is a mischievous baby!\/It started to rain again today. I am afraid I do not like rain here as everything becomes so muddy. Thomas turns our 20 x 25 unit up side down.\/This Sunday on the 4th I attended a missionary conference. The theme was \"Launch Out into the Deep.\" Five of our Caucasian teachers here are missionaries and they told some of their experiences in the field of missionaries. It began from 9:00 until 11:30 in the evening. Morning worship, followed by a picnic lunch. Then we heard a panel discussion about the opportunities and qualifications of missionaries. The evening service began with vesper hour then evening worship. It was a fairly tiring day, but I enjoyed every moment of my first conference. \/I too wish that you may visit Poston! Time certainly flies--it will be a full year since we left San Diego.\/I hope soon peace will come and that I may see you in the very near future. May God be with you until we meet again.\/Most sincerely,\/Margaret Ishino<br>",

Transcription:<br>Feb. 22, 1943\/(1)\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I recieved your letter yesterday but I should have thanked you days ago for the Valetnine cards.  They sure are a lot of fun to make.\/I have been busy lately because our room is being partitioned. (At last!)  I looks nice now because it is white plastic board, but it is rather small.\/Are you having very many blackouts?  We had a practice blackout last night.  It lasted only ten minutes though.  But thats long enough for me.  I've had enough in San Diego and I thought I was getting away from them.\/I started going to the libary a few days ago.  I had a libary card, but the last time I returned a book was in July 10th, 1942.  This time there are more books, but before they didn't have half as much, so the children's books and juvenile were all mixed up on one shelf.  Since there are so many books, the libary is cut in two sections.  One half is the audlt's books and the other half is used as juvenile and childrens books.\/Everybody is playing basketball now days.  I guess it is the season for it.  I really don't care very\/(2)\/much for it, but I made it at least once!\/I have heard from my father.  He is in Gila, but he plans to go out soon.  He sent me a five pound box of candy for Chirstmas, and Chinese checkers.\/I guess thats all the news for now, but I hope next time I won't be so late in writting.\/Yours Truly,<br>Katherine Tasaki\/P.S.\/I'm sorry I have to write with pencill, but we don't have any ink, and there isn't any ink at the canteen so we have to save all we have in our pen.",

Transcription:<br>April 18 '42\/Arcadia\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I am very sorry I haven't written sooner, but I was sick in bed from the typhoid fever shot. There was a sudden change in our going to Owens Valley. But we arrived safely at Santa Anita (which we call Santa Japanita) We started from the station 1:30 a.m. Reached Santa Anita 3:00. Santa Anita is a very beautiful place. You could see the big mountains. In the morning when you could see the shadows of the mountains it looks like the great preyimeds Egypt. Our camp is right near the racetracks of Santa Anita. The stables that the horses used to live in were fived over for us to live in. They gave us many things that we needed like beds, blankets, brooms, and buckets. So we are getting along fine. When we eat we always have to get in a long line about three block. We do not go school yet but we go to the Recreation park to play games. So all we do is eat, play and sleep. But in the evenings I read some of the books I bought. I enjoyed very much to take books out of the library. My mother told me to give your mother her love.\/Yours always,\/Elizabeth Kikuchi\/P.S. I was very glad to see you at the station.",

I liked them very much because they are all new to me. \/Everybody urged my mother to get a stove, so she finally got one. \/But it smells so much that we can't use it.\/Everybody (at least the men) is getting cane crazy nowadays. They go to the mountain and chop of a branch and make a cane. Some people get the root of a tree and make a vase. If you would walk around five miles you would find sime iron wood. There are lot of beautiful rocks too. My girl friend and I went hunting for some under the house. There are some that glistened, but my mother said it wasn't gold, but we make believe it is so we are satisfied. When we go home I want to take some with me and put them into a ring or a bracelet. \/It is so cold that we don't go to school until noon. I catch so many colds and stay in bed so long that my teacher says I spoil her attendance.\/My mother has a job as a dietishions aide. She goes to lectures every week. She has to learn what food have what vitamans and what to eat.\/I'm sorry that your Chirstmas preasent is so late, but my mother has been very busy. Anyway you can be expecting a small package.\/ Katherine Tasaki",

I suppose my brother wrote to you about my being out here in Preston. I didn't plan to come out here on an indefinite. It all started when I went to Ogden, Utah with a group of girls to work at the cannery peeling tomatoes. This work was to last about a month--when that was completed I decided to visit the Obayashi family in Idaho since it was only a few hours ride. \/Unexpectedly I was offered a job at Paul's Cafe. The salary of $80.00 a month dazzled me so I accepted. The boss, Mr. Merrill is very nice--he has two boys in the Navy. Farrell, the younger son is home on a 9 day leave. He (Farrel) has a wife and a two months old boy--looks just like his grandfather.\/The weather out here is quite a change from the warm climate of California and Arizona. It snows quite often now. Just hope it stays like this and we'll really have a white Christmas.\/The young people have a regular ice skating rink here, and I'm sure making good use of it. I'm planning to take some skiing lessons as soon as I find time.\/I'm staying at a small rooming house. Mrs. Struves, my land lady, is a very sweet woman. She has ten children, four girls and six boys. Three of her boys and two girls are in California. One of her sons is married to Mrs. Merrill's sister. I don't know how many grandchildren she has--I'll know for sure when they all get together for Christmas eve.\/Well I'll have to close for now. It's almost time for me to go to work.\/Yaeko\/P.S.

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>July 17, 1944\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Thank you for your nice letter. Time flies by so fast and it's terribly hard to keep track of. Amazingly enough, I've been here now 2 1\/2 months! What's been happening in that time, I just can't say.\/I can't recall what I told you about my trip so if I repeat myself you'll have to excuse me. We found my father in the best of health and in very good humor. All the men have become jolly and very carefree. The pictures we had of him while he was in Santa Fe showed him to be very wrinkled and old looking, but we were pleased to find him looking almost unchanged except possibly for a little less hair on his head. We told him that, and he replied that he took old-looking pictures so that we would be pleased with the real McCoy. He has something there! I purchased a trunk for a lady (formerly a SD gal) and she seemed very pleased with it. She informed me that the folks are fine and both are happy. I'm very pleased that both pop and mom are fine. Wish they could join us, but that's impossible for the duration, at any rate. Hope to visit them sometime, though. I really miss them.\/My brother is still in Milwaukee attending Marquette University. So far he hasn't been called, and we're hoping that he can get into Med School all right. He will be graduating in Nov., I believe. Which Med School he will enter is still undecided. He has become quite a student--medicine is his full life-goal and he eats, sleeps, studies and talks medicine. Even though he is my brother, I'm quite proud of him and respect him for what he is and hopes to be. I'm glad he has the ambition and will to be something better than just a workingman. He will have lots of hardships but he'll come up through all well, I know.\/My sister Fuji and brother-in-law Bill had a nice week's vacation in Cincinnati with some of their friends. Yours truly stayed with some girl friends, and then invited them over for a while. The week really passed fast. Both Bill and Foo came back refreshed mentally but physically exhausted from the hectic trainride. Their trip was quite hard on their pocketbook but well worth it as they had a wonderful time. Although we should not travel, I believe that it's OK for the sake of the morale as we're doing our part, though small, in the war effort.\/I was quite surprised and pleased to learn that Aiko Kubo is planning to go to Hameline University. About a month ago I had the pleasure of staying over the week-end with Ikuko Kuratomi (formerly S.D.) at Hewett's lodge. She is attending Hameline and studying to be a Medical Technician. We walked on the campus and she told me about it. It's very old, not too expensive, and has a nice college atmosphere. The school is small and students get to know each other as most of them live on the campus or nearby. \/What a pleasant surprise to learn that Miss McNary is now Mrs. Gilliland! I can picture her as a wonderful housekeeper but it's hard to imagine her with more weight on her! Please express my congratulations to her!\/How are you and the help situation now? Have you found a nice capable person to help you? Have you taken your vacation yet?\/Oh yes, while at Ikuko's place I saw a magazine published at U.C. at Berkeley which had exerpts of letters to your sister from the young niseis who have relocated at various places and schools. Was pleased to find an excerpt from Ikuko's letters and also my brother's! I had to laugh, though at what my brother said--rather at the way he said what he did. He loves big words and used a whole string of 25 c. words just to say that people in Milwaukee had been very receptive and do not seem to even notice them. Did you see that particular issue? It's an old issue, but Ikuko had it.\/Am planning to take some pictures soon, and will be glad to send you one when I get it developed. May I have one of you? I'd really like to have one of you.\/It's now after 10 and time for this hard wo",

I enjoyed them very much.\/ I am sorry for not writing sooner, but we ran out of envelopes and they didn't have any at the canteen.\/ School has started ever since last Monday, so that is where I spend most of my time. We had been haveing a Japenese teacher until Friday. O Friday the princible brought a american teacher. So starting from monday, we have a new teacher. I have to walk 3 blocks to school. We have scholl in a long barrack. it is cut into 3 sections. (we are in the middle.) When we have singing we go into the next room, which is the 4th gr.  By the way, did I tell you I was in the 5th gr.? I had 2 slips. One said to go to the 6th gr. and the other one to go to the 5th gr. We sure do get hard work. Like Fri. we had to write our life history. We had to write the day we were born, the hospital What age we were when we moved from house to house, what age we were when we started school, what the name of the school was, a few other things, and last of all what we liked to do best. Our Japenese teacher wouldn't even let us study any words and she goes and gives us real hard words. Well I guess I'll learn some day. Thank you again.\/Yours Truly,\/Katherine Tasaki\/P.S.\/For the first time since I came here my mother put on curlers. But I'm afraid it won't turn out good because my is too long. It doesn't pay to pay 3.00 and get a permanent.",

Here in camp we have adobe schools. And I am in the 7th grade now.\/We are going to celebrate Thanksgiving this Thursday and we have a vacation from school.\/ My father and I go fishing at Colorado River every week end.\/It is getting very cold here. My Mother and Father send their very best regards.\/Yours Truly\/Jack Watanabe\/P.S. Please write soon.\/November 21,1944\/ Dear Miss Breed,\/We are very sorry we didn't write to you sooner but it had just slipped our minds.\/Several teachers went to San Diego several weeks ago and said it was avery nice place but it was very clouded. They brought my brother's car up here and Dick and I plan to go back east on it. I am planning to go to Cleveland in January and finish high school. My sister is out there now and says it is very cold.\/Here at Poston the weather is very cold. Last week it rained every day and in the mornings it is about 40.\/Jack goes to school everyday and is now in the seventh grade. Every once in a while he reminds to write to you so finally I got ambisious and wrote. Well I guess that is all for now.\/Sincerely\/William Watanabe",

        "description":"1 letter and envelope from Margaret Ishino to Clara Breed + drawing by Florence Ishino.  Transcription:<br>October 19, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Christmas arrived early for the San Diegans and for those who were at Santa Anita. Our Sears clothing came Thursday! Everything I ordered came except a sweater. Florence was lacking a few things, but we are all sincerely thankful for what the Government has done for us. Little Thomas and Florence were each given an excellent pair of shoes, which Florence could hardly wait to try on.\/School is similar to San Diego. We are using the California method. Florence seems much happier here in school than San Diego because of her many Japanese classmates. I have an American teacher for Core Studies (History and English) and find her very nice. Incidentally Louise is also in three of my classes. At present we are studying the agriculture of Poston and the economic conditions of United States. I am taking  Bookkeeping and Shorthand both under Nisei teachers. They are mostly University students who have already graduated or were about to, and I think they make good teachers.\/I am typing this letter by Thomas who is dropping everything from his crib. He will not stay still for a moment. On the 27th he will be 9 months. He has his 6 teeth now and certainly is making good use of them.\/Today is the last day of a 3 day County Fair in Camp 1. Last night I went with some of my girl friends on a huge truck. There were mostly exhibits. I found much talent displayed at the Fair by different people from each of the 3 camps who made and drew many clever things. Miniture plans were skillfully made of a nursery, fish cannery, and poultry. They sold candy, pop corns, ice cream, hot dogs and hamburgers for eats. I was certainly glad to go to the Fair, because it was something different after so long. \/Florence drew a picture of a dog at school which she would like you to have. She hopes you like it. How is the library coming along? Do you have more children since school started. \/Please give my regards to Miss McNary. Florence sends you her best wishes.\/Sincerely,\/",

A flowering tree on portable shrine is located directly behiind him and in front of entry to the church.  Standing to the right, two men in Buddhist robes and vestments, or okesa, around their necks, Rev. I Kyogoku and Rev. T. Terakawa.

Transcription:<br>Santa Anita Assembly Center\/Dist. 5 F-27-5\/Arcadia, California\/August 20, 1942\/Dear Miss Breed,I guess it must be my turn to write to you because I have not heard from you recently. Thank you for sending me the puzzles and also for going to all the trouble of cutting them out of the daily papers for me.\/I think that I must have forgotten to thank you for sending me the book, too. I read it and two days later it was loaned out and it has been going around ever since. About ten different people have read it and it is still circulating. It was very interesting and was a little different from most of the \"career books\" because it told of failure as well as fortune. \"Frills and Thrills\" really showed the back angle of modelling.\/One of the advantages in this camp is the time to read some of the classic literature which I didn't read at home. Since there are not many new books I am trying to catch up in the classic literature. I have read quite a few short story books and some fiction books.\/It seems as though we are going to move soon. We have been having many departmental dances. Last week I went to the Finance division dance and also the Camouflage unit dance. They were both very nice. It was quite a novelty to dance on a smooth floor and inside and also to have eats during the dance. Usually dances are held on the side of the grandstand and under the stars. We never have refreshments except at home. We miss a drive-in or something cool to drink after the dances. The canteens close at 5:30 so it is impossible to keep drinks cool after that.\/The other night the girls' clubs held a jamboree. It is something like the girls' hi-jinx at school. Our club, the Kappa Gammas were supposed to do a strip tease act, but we backed out. We did help out with decorating the stage, though. It started out rather corny, but as time went on it really was something worth seeing. I have enclosed a copy of the program which I hope you will find interesting. I will tell you about the skits which placed first, second, and third. First was the Santa nooga Choo choo, which part of the girls sang while other brought forth on the stage a choo choo train. As the train was turning round and round trees and cities passed by. It was cute and very well done. During the song some girls kept shouting \"Poston, here we come!\"\/Second, which I thought was the best, was Scrap Fashions. This was really beautiful. It showed that a great deal of work had been put into making the outfits. They were all made of tissue paper gotten from the mess halls and also toilet paper (which we call ration paper). They had a play suit, a date dress, and also a wedding dress. The wedding dress really was a masterpiece. This skit ended with the offer of the whole trousseau to anyone who intended to get married in the near future.\/Third was \"Cindy Ella\" a blackface story of \"Cinderella.\" It was cute and very well acted. It was modernized with a geta for the slipper.\/You must be very busy with the summer vacation coming to an end. You never did tell me about your vacation. My brother got a letter from your sister in Berkeley. I don't know whether he has answered her or not.\/My sister and her husband are celebrating their first wedding anniversary on the 31st. I am making him a pair of sox, while my mother is crocheting them a beautiful runner. I got my sister some cologne which I think she will enjoy.\/I haven't mentioned food very much lately, have I? Well, on the whole it is good. We have good and bad days here. I guess we're so used to the food we don't say much about it now. We groan in the mess hall when it is awful, but that's about all. I think that I must have lost a little bit of weight because my wrist watch has moved up a fraction of an inch up my arm. Gee, I'm curious to see how much I weigh now.\/According to the latest rumors the way we are going to go o",

Always am glad to hear news from \"Old S.D.\"\/I'm trying to catch up with my letters because I have plenty of time. Well, I have something else now to add to my collection of diseases. Flu.\/The first few days it was awful. It wouldn't of been so bad if it hadn't been for the fever.\/My last letter to you was so long ago that I can't remember if I thanked you for the book you sent me? I certinly hope I did, but if I haven't, I shall do so now.\/\"It is the best book I have ever received, and out of all my 40, I am proud to say that \"Spotlight for Danny\" is my favorite.\"\/How's that? Really, Miss Breed, that is one of the most lifelike stories I have ever read. And I have read many stories too!\/Thank you ever so much for the dollar. It has helped us along a great deal. I hope that one of these days I can repay you for all you have done for us. Thank you again.\/I am glad that you liked my present. I agree with you that bugs are awful. I tried catching some, but it didn't work out. So now you needn't be in fear that I shall send you any.\/I doubt if we have skinks out here. There may be some though. There is a very long lizard that has been hanging around here for weeks. One time I was running around the corner of the house, and I almost stepped on him! I was too scared for a while to scream, and when I did get my voice back, he was gone.\/I can imagine how you felt at book week. It is certinly a coincidence, but Sherman School &amp; Lincoln happen to be the very ones I went to! My, but I certinly do miss both of them. I have been on the Sherman School stage often. I think it is fun. The part that I enjoy most is the door at the back which lead into a classroom. And it happens to be the very room where my favorite teacher used to teach. Her name is Miss Jensen. She sent me a card once, when I was in Santa Anita, but that was the last I heard of her.\/One of the nicest teachers at Sherman - or so I heard  - was to be my 4th grade teacher. My, but wasn't I glad. But, we had to move, so I didn't get to have her. But still, I got Miss George.\/ I hear that she got married. Miss George did, I mean. I didn't get to know the teachers at Lincoln very well, because we were way in the corner. I like Lincoln schools auditorium better than Sherman, because it is brighter, but I have never been on Lincoln's stage. The curtains arrangement looks better, though.\/I'm sorry I have to say I don't know \"The Twelve Wild Ducks\" or \"The Little Mermaid.\" I don't know which is my favorite fairy story. I've read so many, that it would be hard to say.\/I'm glad you like the getas. We wear them to shower, to keep our feet from getting cut or anything. Sometimes we wear them as slippers. Almost every 9 out of 10 people in Poston has getas.\/ They are easily made, or so the men say. The women make the straps usually.\/ This winter is certinly strange. Every morning it is cloudy, and it lasts all through till night, so that we have to keep our lights on all day. Last winter wasn't at all like this. In the morning you feel as if you could wear 2 coats, and at noon you feel like taking off every thing.\/ If it's going to rain, I wish it would hurry up and get done with it!\/Warmly yours,\/ Katherine",

Transcription:<br>October 5, 1943\/Dear Miss Breed,\/I was very glad to receive a letter from you and I am the one that should apologize. I try to get my letters out on time but sometimes my work interferes and I don't get around to my letter writing.\/As for the gifts, to hear that you liked them and enjoyed them is thanks enough. Maybe in the near future we may be able to send you some more nice and unusuable presents.\/Mother was very glad to know that you liked the flower picture. Yes, we have a few decorating our apartment. \/Really, I don't know very much about iron wood either. I never did get a chance to go with the people when they went to the mountains to get iron wood. After the heart was cut out, it was sanded (sand-papered), and then shellac was put on to give it a shiny finish. The color is natural.\/Yes, my brother had polio. He used to work in a florist shop. He is much better now. He is home with us. He had to use crutches for awhile but he is getting so that he depends on them less and less. It won't be very long now before he won't need his crutches at all.\/You must of been very busy with all your talks, etc. I am sure the children and especially the parents appreciate all you have done and are doing for them.\/ We probably wouldn't recognize San Diego if we were given a chance to go back. I've heard that it is very crowded. I'm sure everyone is aware of the shortage of houses and food and I am sure everyone is willing to cooperate and do their part. All this rationing, etc. haven't really hit us so I guess we don't realize what it is really like.\/I am working in the education office as secretary to the business manager. Louise Ogawa is working there too. We are kept quite busy doing typing, shorthand, etc.\/ Many people (including my friends) here left for outside employment. I want to go too but I guess I'll have to wait. With my brother in that condition and being the next oldest my mother hasn't given her consent so I am waiting and hoping for a chance to go out. There are many nice jobs open at the present. What most of us really would like to do is go to San Diego (home) and work but when we'll be able to, no one knows. I'll be sure to look you up though when the time comes. Please write, I'll be waiting to hear from you.\/As ever--\/Hisako",

Transcription:<br>Dear Miss McNary, \/ Thank you very much for the nice letter. \/ School is so dull I don't enjoy it as much as I did back home. (I'm in the fifth grade.) I sure do wish I could have seen Santa again. \/ If only I didn't have to come into camp maybe I could be borrowing five books too. \/ But I sure did learn a lot. And I picked pretty rocks with my girlfriend. And we just have to go under the house. They're very pretty too. But in the mountains there are pretier ones. We just don't think we would care to walk three of four miles. \/ My mother bought bought me a book, (Mrs. Miniver) a big paint book and she knitted my doll a cap for Chirstmas. \/ I sure do wish I brought my own paper dolls so that I don't have to play with my girl friend's. But it isn't my fault because when we went to register they told us just to take what we could carry. When we got to the station the red cap took our bags so we could have brought half the house. I was going to bring my ball but I thought it would take up extra space so I didn't bring it. Miss Fay sent me one while we were in Santa Anita but I played with it at night and I lost it so that is my own fault. \/ I can't think of anything to write so I'll close now. \/ Yours truly, \/ Katherine Tasaki \/ P.S. \/ My mother has been so busy that she didn't get down to sending \"it,\" but I hope you like your Chirstmas preasant from my mother and I and I am sorry it is so late.  Transcription:<br>I \/ Dec. 18, 1943 \/ Poston, Arizona \/ Dear Miss Mcnary, \/ Please forgive me for not writing to you for so long. How's S.D.? Guess what? I just learned that at 12:00 tonight we have to turn our clock back one hour. That means California time! \/ I've written two letters today, so I have to rest now. I will continue this tomorrow. \/ Dec. 19, 1943 \/ Here I am again! I just took a pill, and that wasn't any too pleasing. \/ I've certianly collected a lot of Poston souviners. We kept all the invitations we got, and my mothers friend gave me a Hawaiian doll made out of crepe paper. I wish I could learn how to make things out of crepe paper. But every time I try anything with it, I get the feeling that they will tear. \/ I can't think of anything to write about. Maybe one of my stories will interest you. I haven't gotten any name for it, but I will leave you to do that. Before I start, let me tell you what gave me the idea. Our teacher told us to write any kind of story we want--provided it's original--but it must start with, \"John and Jack were turning the corner when---.\" This is how I went on. \/ John and Jack were turning the corner when they suddenly came upon a figure slinking away into the shadows. \"Something querr about that fellow.\" said Jack. \"Never mind. Right now we have to get home.\" The eleven-year-old Henry twins were just coming home from a baseball game in the next town, four miles away. After the game, they had gone to visit an old friend. Having stayed longer than they expected, they missed the last bus. So now we find the twins just getting home. \/ \"Well, here you are! I was just going out after you!\" said Mr. Henry. \"How was the game?\" John answered, \"Fine sir. We won. If it wasn't for Harry Barnes, we would have lost.\" \/ Harry Barnes was a new boy in town. He had come several months ago, saying he was an orphan. Old Mr. Laurence hired him to work in his drug-store, but when the \"Daleton Tigers\" saw what a swell player he was, they begged Mr. Laurence into giving him afternoons off once in a while to practice. \/ That night while the boys slept, Jack thought he heard an explosion. \"Aw, you're always imagining things.\" John answered when Jack told him. \/ The next morning there was a great commotion outside. Both the twins rushed downstairs and said at once, \"What's the matter?\" Mr. Henry said, \"The airplane factory was blown up.\" The twins looked at each other. So that was the noise Jack heard last night! \/ Later, as they were on they'r",

Transcription:<br>January 18, 1943 \/ Dear Miss Breed, \/ Thank you very kindly for sending me such a worthwhile book. History being my favorite and biographies being my favorite reading, \"There Were Giants in the Land\" is certainly a two in one book. A few authors are familiar to me; and I agree 100 per cent with Mr. Morgenthau's introduction. By reading this book, I can learn what these 28 giants did for us Americans. \/ Today has certainly been dusting and chilly throughout the day. The weather here has been very changeable lately. How is the weather in San Diego? \/ Florence drew you a picture of a house with an apple tree and flowers on each side. She hopes you will like it. It will not be long before Thomas becomes a year old. He is growing bigger day by day. Whenever I write about Thomas I just wish I could send you a snapshot of him. He has not taken one picture, but I can remember him as a baby even now. \/ I am sending you a copy of our school news paper. I am very proud of it and I think it is equal to the \"Russ,\" the San Diego Hish paper. The students get it weekly free of charge. \/ Please give our regards to Miss McNary. \/ Sincerely, \/ Margaret Ishino",

        "description":"1 postcard from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 21, 1943\/Dear Miss Breed,\/Regret to inform you that for the good of the country and morale of the U.S. Army I have been \"rejected for general military service as a result of the physical examination.\" I have applied for limited military service although present plans do not include limited service men in the Japanese American Combat Unit. I had hopes of visiting San Diego after induction in Salt Lake City (Fort Douglas). Perhaps later I'll get the chance. At any rate until further orders I am in the rejected class.\/Received your telegram yesterday (Apr. 20) morning. Should have saved money by writing a postcard. Mail comes two days after the post mark. Received kind letter and handkerchief from Mrs. Follick today. It was very nice of her.\/I am glad the nut brittle reached you. I bought that at the Fox candy store on ?Washington?Street? (I don't know the address) in Phoenix on my way back from a visit to the Gila Relocation Camp.\/Sincerely yours\/Ted.",
