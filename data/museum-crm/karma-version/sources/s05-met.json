His intention to create panoramic views of the American frontier was apparent by December 1858, just before he embarked on the trip. In early 1859 he accompanied a government survey expedition, headed by Frederick W. Lander, to the Nebraska Territory. By summer, the party had reached the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains in what is now Wyoming. Bierstadt dubbed the central mountain in the picture Lander's Peak following the colonel's death in the Civil War. This was one of a number of large works painted after Bierstadt's return from these travels. It was completed in 1863, exhibited to great acclaim, and purchased in 1865 for the then-astounding sum of $25,000 by James McHenry, an American living in London. Bierstadt later bought it back and gave or sold it to his brother Edward.",

This apparently was one of the pictures that he brought with him, and he sent it later that year for sale to the American Art-Union. It was first called \"French-Trader\u2014Half breed Son,\" but the Art-Union gave it the title by which it is now known. Bingham, whose earliest efforts were portraits, produced a masterpiece of genre painting with little precedent in his oeuvre. The strikingly spare, geometric composition and luminist light recall the paintings of William Sidney Mount, particularly his \"Eel Spearing at Setauket\" (New York State Historical Association, Cooperstown). The solemn, motionless scene immortalizes the vanished world of the American frontier, constructed for a northeastern audience. The tranquil work was submitted to the Art-Union as a possible companion to the more implicitly violent \"The Concealed Enemy\" (Stark Museum of Art, Orange, Texas), in which an armed Osage warrior lies in wait behind a boulder. The polar opposition of quietude, savagery, and frontier danger embodied in the paintings held enormous appeal for urban viewers. Bingham painted a similar, though less extraordinary, picture called \"The Trapper's Return\" (Detroit Institute of Arts) in New York in 1851.",

        "Description":"Long known as \"The Oxbow,\" this work is a masterpiece of American landscape painting, laden with possible interpretations. In the midst of painting \"The Course of Empire\" (New-York Historical Society), Cole mentioned in a letter dated March 2, 1836, to his patron Luman Reed that he was executing a large version of this subject expressly for exhibition and sale. The picture was shown at the National Academy of Design in 1836 as \"View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm.\" Cole's interest in the subject probably dates from his 1829-32 trip to Europe, during which he made an exact tracing of the view published in Basil Hall's \"Forty Etchings Made with the Camera Lucida in North America in 1827 and 1828.\" Hall criticized Americans' inattentiveness to their scenery, and Cole responded with a landscape that lauds the uniqueness of America by encompassing \"a union of the picturesque, the sublime, and the magnificent.\" Although often ambiguous about the subjugation of the land, here the artist juxtaposes untamed wilderness and pastoral settlement to emphasize the possibilities of the national landscape, pointing to the future prospect of the American nation. Cole's unequivocal construction and composition of the scene, charged with moral significance, is reinforced by his depiction of himself in the middle distance, perched on a promontory painting the Oxbow. He is an American producing American art, in communion with American scenery. There are both sketchbook drawings with annotations and related oil sketches of this subject. Many other artists copied or imitated the painting.",

While attending Columbia College (formerly King's College), he married Elizabeth Johnson, daughter of the president of Columbia. They had two children. Following her death in 1789, Verplanck married Ann Walton, with whom he had seven children. They lived on Wall Street until 1803 and then moved to Fishkill-on-Hudson, New York. He represented Dutchess County in Congress from 1803 until 1809. The portrait was painted in 1771 when Daniel was nine years old. The background has traditionally been identified as a view from the Verplanck country house at Fishkill, looking toward Mount Gulian.",

This, the first major work in the series, probably commemorates the victory of Max Schmitt (1843-1900), an attorney and skilled amateur rower, in an important race held on the Schuylkill River in October 1870. Also an avid rower, Eakins depicted himself pulling the oars of a scull in the middle distance. Eakins constructed the painting according to the academic principles espoused by his primary Parisian teacher, Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me.",

He specialized not in dramatic wilderness subjects, as many of the school did, but preferred more prosaic marshlands and coastal settings. Even when he painted storms, as here, he portrayed not the actual tempest, but its tense preamble of blackening sky and eerily illumined terrain. This painting was based on a sketch of an approaching storm that Heade witnessed on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay about 1858. The image became the basis for a more elaborate and synthetic version of the subject painted in 1868 (Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas).",

First exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia in 1900, the picture was subsequently reworked and \"improved\" by the artist. Early photographs show changes to the sea and to the back of the ship, making the composition more dramatic and vivid. The painting was shown in this state at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1900-01, and then at M. Knoedler and Co. in New York, where the artist placed on the picture the record-asking price of $4,000. There were problems selling the work because of either its high price or its unpleasant subject matter. Homer may have reworked the painting again in the face of this criticism in order to add the rigger on the horizon that signals hope and rescue from the perils of the sea.",

The painting shows the girl at about the age of seventeen, sitting with a sketchbook in her lap and pencil in hand with her eyes raised in contemplation. Although traditionally described as a Muse, the figure is more likely a personification of the art of drawing or design. Morse drew on the full extent of his European training, taking from the works of Rubens and Veronese in what was to be an ambitious farewell to his career as an artist. Stymied by a lack of financial success, he abandoned painting for science and inventing. This painting was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1837, where it won enthusiastic praise. Susan married Edward Lind in 1839 and moved to his sugar plantation in Puerto Rico, returning often to New York to spend extended periods with her father, who had been left a widower when Susan was just six. She gradually grew less and less happy with her husband and plantation life. Lind died in 1882; in 1885, Susan set out to return to New York permanently but tragically was lost at sea.",

In preparation, Peale traveled to the Princeton and Trenton battlefields in February of 1779 to make sketches for the background. The original portrait, the full-length version now in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780. In every other version, Washington is shown after the Battle of Princeton, but here he is depicted after the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the war. It has been suggested that this portrait was commissioned upon the order of Mrs. Washington, because it is the only portrait in which Washington wears his state sword and because the painting descended in the Washington family.",

        "Description":"This sculpture is a reduction of the Victory that is part of the Sherman Monument (1903; New York, Grand Army Plaza). The famed equestrian statue, dedicated to the Civil War hero William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891), is one of Manhattan's finest public sculptures, and a noble heir to the equestrian tradition begun in ancient Rome and continued through the Renaissance. Saint-Gaudens' \"Victory\" has traditional attributes\u2014a laurel crown and a palm leaf\u2014and is depicted by Saint-Gaudens as a guiding force. Her outstretched right arm leads the obediant horse, upon which sits a battle-hardened General Sherman. Saint-Gaudens painstakingly arranged drapery on numerous nude models for \"Victory\" before settling on what he believed was the perfect flow of her robe. Letters written by Saint-Gaudens near the completion of the monument reveal his triumphant feelings about the monument, and the figure of \"Victory.\" In a letter to his niece, Rose S. Nichols, he wrote, \"It's the greatest 'Victory' anybody ever made. Hooraah!\"",

Sargent hoped to enhance his reputation by painting and exhibiting her portrait. Working without a commission but with his sitter\u2019s complicity, he emphasized her daring personal style, showing the right strap of her gown slipping from her shoulder. At the Salon of 1884, the portrait received more ridicule than praise. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap and kept the work for over thirty years. When, eventually, he sold it to the Metropolitan, he commented, \u201cI suppose it is the best thing I have done,\u201d but asked that the Museum disguise the sitter\u2019s name.",

        "Description":"Ward probably began \"The Freedman\" following Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862. The sculptor exhibited a model to acclaim in the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in spring 1863. Contemporary appreciation for the statuette arose from a desire for art that addressed current issues rather than less tangible themes unrelated to American life. Not only does \"The Freedman\" comment on the chief political, social, and moral topic of the era, but it also proclaims Ward's abolitionist sentiments. The seminude man sits on a tree stump, the manacle on his left wrist and the chain in his right hand potent reminders of his former servitude. Enhancing the statuette's powerful theme is Ward's commitment to realism. The fidelity to physiognomy and anatomical accuracy of the twisting body reveal an unprecedented naturalism in nineteenth-century American sculpture.",
