        "DESCRIPTION":"Rudy\u2019s Ramp of Remainders\u00a0is a new sculptural installation by conceptual artist Michael Queenland. Rudy\u2019s Ramp of Remainders was inspired by Rudis Resterampe\u2014which roughly translates to \u201cRudy\u2019s Pile of Leftovers\u201d\u2014a German discount store filled with surplus scraps of textile and discarded cultural items that Queenland discovered during his 2009 fellowship at the American Academy in Berlin. Queenland\u2019s installation transforms various materials into \u201cramps\u201d\u2014loosely grouped remainders and offcuts of objects. These \u201cramps\u201d reveal how commonplace material and cultural items are reshaped and redefined through Queenland\u2019s artistic intervention.\nOrganized by SMMoA s newly appointed curator-at-large Jeffrey Uslip,\u00a0Rudy\u2019s Ramp of Remainders\u00a0takes the form of a surplus environment where Queenland\u2019s sculptural assemblages serve as cultural inventory. Layers of newspapers, folded open and vertically stacked, cover the floor of the exhibition space and serve as the ground on which the new sculptural forms are installed. Plasticized balloons, found objects, industrial bread racks, metal pipes, and perishable goods\u2014that exemplify Queenland\u2019s signature visual vocabulary\u2014are arranged on top of the newspaper.\u00a0Rudy\u2019s Ramp of Remainders\u00a0continues Queenland s examination of cultural, communal, and biographical forms that are at once dislocated from their original context and repositioned in the collective imaginary. A printed interview between Queenland and Uslip accompanies the exhibition.\u00a0\nMajor support for this exhibition has been provided by Marlborough Chelsea, New York, and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding has been provided by the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission; Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Arts Commission; Dean V. Ambrose; Good Works Foundation and Laura Donnelley; Abby Sher; Rosa and Bob Sinnott; The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation; Marla and Jeffrey Michaels; Peter A. Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles; Pasadena Art Alliance; and Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation.\u00a0\nAbout the artist: Michael Queenland was born in 1970 and lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut. He earned Bachelor\u2019s of Arts and Master\u2019s of Fine Arts degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles. Queenland\u2019s work has been shown in such distinguished venues as The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art, Portland; Midway Contemporary Art, Minneapolis; and Massachusetts College of Art, Boston. His work is included in the permanent collection of The Studio Museum in Harlem. Queenland is an assistant professor of sculpture at Yale University Graduate School of Art.\nAbout the curator: Jeffrey Uslip (b. 1977) is a New York-based independent curator, who has organized exhibitions for PS1\/MOMA, New York, Artists Space, New York, Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, California State University, Los Angeles, and LAXART, Los Angeles.

        "DESCRIPTION":"Agnes Denes:\u00a0Body Prints, Philosophical Drawings, and Map Projections, 1969 \u2013 1978\u00a0is an exhibition of seminal drawings by Land artist Agnes Denes. As an influential pioneer of the Environmental and Conceptual Art movements, Denes\u2019s artistic practice applies the exacting precision and unwavering consistency of mathematics to the often subjective, tenuous, and unstable concepts of ecological awareness and environmental sustainability. The three discrete bodies of work on view at SMMoA demonstrate how Denes marshals the disciplines of geometry, philosophy, cartography, and the physical sciences to create \u201cVisual Philosophy\u201d \u2014her signature method of illustrating how we exist in the world. The exhibition will be on view at SMMoA from September 15 through December 22, 2012.\nOrganized by SMMoA s newly appointed curator-at-large Jeffrey Uslip,\u00a0Agnes Denes: Body Prints, Philosophical Drawings, and Map Projections, 1969 \u2013 1978\u00a0revisits the complex theoretical propositions Denes set forth at the onset of her career. For the past five decades, Denes\u2019s practice has become synonymous with ecologically driven interventions into the landscape and socially driven approaches that symbiotically engage with the environment. Denes\u2019s Body Prints overlay impressions of human breasts and phalluses onto sheets of graph paper to humorously, yet poignantly, transform the body into social critique.\nIn\u00a0Napoleonic Series: Investigation of World Rulers I   Napoleon Overlooking the Elba\u00a0(1971), Denes transfers the impressions of four penises onto graph paper, creating a sardonic allegory for a, perhaps inadequate, representation of male power. Denes locates this drawing on Elba, the island off the western coast of Italy where Napoleon was first exiled in 1814. By contrast,\u00a0Design of the Universe\u00a0(1971) reveals a body print of a female breast morphologically likened to the globe in a more optimistic and fertile projection of the future.\nDenes\u2019s series of\u00a0Philosophical Drawings\u00a0appropriates the veracity of mathematical symmetry and geometric codes to provide shape \u2014a visual logic\u2014to ways of\u00a0being\u00a0in the world and\u00a0visualizing\u00a0invisible passages of time.\u00a0Map Projections\u00a0depicts the globe reconfigured in various spatial distortions and three-dimensional shapes, including seashells, dodecahedrons, ova, cubes, and pyramids. While always academically rigorous, Denes never forgoes her insightful wit: in the drawing\u00a0Isometric Systems in Isotropic Space   Map Projections: The Hot Dog\u00a0(1976), the world is rendered as an elongated, phallic hot dog. Denes\u2019s method of embedding meaning within the structure of geometric forms allows her to interrogate and undermine issues of representation through Cartesian order. Or more poetically, in Denes\u2019s words, \u201cI love mathematics because I could humanize it, and in turn it gave me perfection and beauty.\u201d\u00a0\nThe catalog for this exhibition is made possible by Peter A. Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles and Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects.\nMajor support for Santa Monica Museum of Art exhibitions has been provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding has been provided by the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission; Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Arts Commission; Dean V. Ambrose; Good Works Foundation and Laura Donnelley; Abby Sher; Rosa and Bob Sinnott; The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation; Marla and Jeffrey Michaels; Pasadena Art Alliance; and Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation.\u00a0\nAbout the artist: Agnes Denes was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1931, raised in Sweden, and educated in the United States. She has participated in solo exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (1974); the ICA, London (1979) and retrospective surveys at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (1992); the Samek Art Gallery, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA (2003); and the Ludwig Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2008).

        "DESCRIPTION":"Isa Melsheimer: Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West is a never-before-seen installation that explores Hollywood s cinematic heyday and its motion picture icons, investigating notions of glamour and luxury as they relate to characters, architecture, and locations in and around Los Angeles.\nSanta Monica Museum of Art Deputy Director Lisa Melandri is curator of Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, in which the artist utilizes commonplace, and largely domestic materials, to create site-specific environments, including a mixture of altered and embroidered t-shirts, live plants, paper, pearls, yarn constructions, and cast concrete sculptures.\nDuring a 2007 residency at Villa Aurora a nonprofit organization located in Pacific Palisades dedicated to German-American cultural exchange Melsheimer became interested in Los Angeles s landscape and architecture, as well as the fictional and historical characters that inhabit these spaces.\nInfluenced by classic Hollywood films such as David Lynch s Mulholland Drive and Billy Wilder s Sunset Boulevard, and the stories of James Graham Ballard, Melsheimer examines the affects of architecture and location on Los Angeles s glamorized cinematic figures; as well as the demise of those figures from lifestyles of fame and financial success. Melsheimer is particularly drawn to examples such as the Salton Sea, a former glamorous resort area new Palm Springs that has since degenerated into a kind of wasteland, and the character Norma Desmond and her shabby mansion from Wilder s iconic film.\nWith Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, Melsheimer wants viewers to be aware that architecture is always representative of ideas or subjects that permeate society. She asks viewers to consider: Which fictional and historical subjects are admired within Los Angeles? Why do residents emigrate from Los Angeles? What aesthetics characterize Los Angeles s buildings; and what sentiments manifest in the region s architecture?\nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.\nSupport for Isa Melsheimer: Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West has been provided in part by Institut f\u00fcr Auslandsbeziehungen e.V.\u00a0\nAbout the artist:Melsheimer (b. 1968) was born in Neuss, Germany, and lives and works in Berlin. She attended the Hochschule der K\u00fcnste (Academy of Fine Arts), Berlin, and completed a master class with painter Georg Baselitz.\nMelsheimer s work has been shown in solo exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout Europe, including in Paris at Galerie Jocelyn Wolff, in N\u00eemes at Mus\u00e9e d Art Contemporain, in Vienna at Galerie N\u00e4chst St. Stephan, in Berlin at Esther Schipper Gallery, in Switzerland at Kunsthaus Langenthal, in Maastricht, Netherlands at Bonnefantenmuseum, and in Marfa, Texas at The Chinati Foundation.

        "DESCRIPTION":"Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe\u00a0is\u00a0the first major solo museum exhibition for the New York-based multi-media artist. Best known for her elaborate paintings of African American women against the backdrop of d\u00e9cor recalled from her childhood, Thomas has created an all-new suite of works that examine aspects of landscape painting. She introduces a new model of trans-generational female empowerment as she explores interior and exterior environments in relation to the female figure. The exhibition opens at SMMoA on April 14, 2012 and continues through August 18, 2012. It will then travel to the Brooklyn Museum for display from September 28, 2012 to January 20, 2013.\nThomas is best known for her bold enamel and acrylic paintings adorned with rhinestones, glitter, and  bling.  Her subjects seem to have stepped directly from a 1970s Blaxploitation film, yet Thomas s influences extend far beyond. Her oeuvre stems from her long study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life. Thomas s layered\u00a0facture\u00a0process begins with a photographic portrait that is translated into a collage, and ultimately reenvisioned as a painting. Her imagery comprises careful borrowings from art history and from contemporary popular culture.\nFor\u00a0Origin of the Universe, Thomas examines art historical constructs of feminine identity, sexuality, beauty, and power in 15 works in a variety of sizes, shapes, and media. Taking cues from Marcel Duchamp s\u00a0\u00c9tant Donn\u00e9s: 1\u00b0 la chute d eau, 2\u00b0 le gaz d \u00e9clairage\u00a0(Given: 1.\u00a0The Waterfall, 2.\u00a0The Illuminating Gas) and Gustave Courbet s L Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), Thomas presents the female figure as the origin of the universe, focusing on how the female body both engenders and inhabits landscape. The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.\nIn nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent\u00a0\u00c9tant Donn\u00e9s, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.\nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.\nMickalene Thomas was born in 1971. She earned a Bachelor s of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute and a Master s of Fine Arts from Yale University. She has participated in residency programs at the Versailles Foundation Munn Artists Program, Giverny, France, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York. Her work has been shown in group exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, The Renaissance Society, Chicago, and MoMA PS1, New York, and is included in the important collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; The Museum of Fine Arts Boston; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\nMickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe\u00a0is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art; SMMoA Deputy Director Lisa Melandri is the exhibition curator. The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of free, engaging public programs and a full-color, illustrated catalog published by SMMoA and distributed by DAP.

        "DESCRIPTION":"Park Studio: Complex Elements is an exhibition of original glass-blown works by 24 high school student participants from Santa Monica and Watts who have participated in SMMoA s distinguished, annual Park Studio interdisciplinary arts education program.\nComplex Elements showcases an array of colorless, clear glass vessels in various sizes, forming an abstract sculptural arrangement. These unusual glass-blown forms are the result of a unique collaboration between students from Santa Monica High School, Olympic High School, and Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center, and students from the Watts Labor Community Action Committee s (WLCAC) glass program. In addition, the exhibition will feature a film that shows the participants  process of learning how to blow glass and the skill-sharing that develops between students throughout the program.\nThe free Park Studio: Complex Elements education program took place during the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District s (SMMUSD) spring break, from April 2 through April 5, 2012. Held at the WLCAC s glass studio in Watts, Park Studio: Complex Elements included a visit to SMMoA and the Watts Towers. Participating students learned the practice of glass blowing from WLCAC artist Jaime Guerrero and his assistant, artist Richard Franco, as well as from year-round students in the WLCAC glass program. All workshops included transportation, lunch, refreshments, and art materials.\nComplex Elements highlights the collaboration between the disparate communities of Santa Monica and Watts. Students from Santa Monica are recruited from the Pico\/Cloverfield neighborhood, Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center, Santa Monica High School s Art Program, and Olympic High School (a continuation school where students are eligible for semester elective credit toward obtaining their high school diploma). Students from the WLCAC glass program will help to impart the knowledge of glass blowing to the youth from Santa Monica and will exhibit their work at SMMoA.\nEach year, Park Studio explores themes that combine art and urban life. The glass blowing program in Watts works with at-risk youth to build confidence, pride, and skills to work collaboratively through the creation of glass objects. Glass is beautiful and fragile a metaphor for high-school student s transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Park Studio, founded in 1999 by SMMoA s Director of Education Asuka Hisa, is an innovative interdisciplinary art education program that serves the community. Through Park Studio, SMMoA brings local students and contemporary artists together for workshops, art history lessons and field trips to cultural sites, offering extraordinary extra-curricular opportunities to students for free.\nSupport for Park Studio: Complex Elements has been provided by the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Grant Program and the Eileen Harris Norton Family Foundation. In-kind support has been provided by Bergamot Station Arts Center, IZZE, Cliff Bar, Bergamot Caf\u00e9, and the Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Milton Glaser for Lapchi: An Exploration of Pattern Making and Color Effects in Textiles is\u00a0a special weeklong exhibition of the newest work by this iconic American graphic designer. Milton Glaser for Lapchi revitalizes SMMoA s relationship with Glaser and features a unique selection of original, hand-made Lapchi carpets, designed and conceptualized by the artist.\nWith Milton Glaser for Lapchi, SMMoA continues a collaboration that began with Glaser more than a decade ago. In 2001, SMMoA presented Milton Glaser, an exhibition that brought together nearly 70 posters and sketches produced by the artist from his distinctive 1966 Dylan poster to his series for the Teatro Massimo opera house in Italy. In conjunction with Milton Glaser, SMMoA collaborated with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIA) to present a reception, lecture, and book signing to celebrate the publication of Glaser s acclaimed book Milton Glaser: Art is Work. With Milton Glaser for Lapchi, SMMoA is thrilled to again present the work of this seminal artist, whose influence on the graphic and commercial arts has been widespread and profound for more than 60 years.\nGlaser is among the most influential designers in the world. A renowned graphic and architectural designer, his prolific body of work ranges from eminent logos to complete graphic and decorative programs for worldwide clientele. Glaser s illustrious career includes the design and illustration of more than 300 posters, and graphic and architectural commissions for clients in the areas of publishing, music, theater, film, institutional and civic enterprise, and commercial products and services. Among Glaser s most admired works are his  I ? NY  campaign, which was designed for the 1975 New York State slogan, the complete design and artwork for Tony Kushner s Pulitzer Prize-winning play  Angels in America,  the signature brand logo for Trump Vodka, and the complete interior design for Rockefeller Plaza s Rainbow Room.\nSMMoA s first look at the Milton Glaser for Lapchi collection marks the launch of a new collaboration between the legendary artist and the preeminent Lapchi hand-woven custom carpet company. The collection will include 25 distinctive, full size carpets, featuring designs inspired by the mystical to historic pattern references woven in light and dark colorations. The entire collection, on view exclusively at SMMoA during the exhibition, is available in a limited edition of 100 for each design and color scheme. Each carpet will be privately labeled and numbered with the Milton Glaser for Lapchi brand logo. The collection is shown primarily in 8  x 10  sizes, but may be custom sized for decorative flooring or display as wall art.\nThe Milton Glaser for Lapchi collection is woven using Tibetan wool in combination with fine silk from India and China. Untouched by chemical washes or bleach throughout production, the carpets are handspun in the traditional Tibetan sena knot and small pot dyed to create a natural abrashed appearance. Lapchi carpets are certified by GoodWeave, an organization that works to end child labor in the carpet industry and offer educational opportunities to children in South Asia.\nAbout the artist:Glaser (b. 1929) was born, works, and lives in New York City. He attended The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York and, the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, Italy where he studied with painter Giorgio Morandi. He holds honorary doctorates from Minneapolis Institute of Arts; Moore College of Art   Design; Philadelphia Museum School; School of Visual Arts; Queens College, CUNY; University at Buffalo, New York; and the Royal College of Art in London. Glaser co-founded the revolutionary Pushpin Studios, he founded and was design director of New York Magazine with Clay Felker, established Milton Glaser, Inc., and teamed with Walter Bernard to form the publication design firm WBMG. Glaser received the Honors Awards from the American Institute of Architects (AIA); the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Smithsonian Copper-Hewitt, National Design Museum; and in 2010, he became the first designer to receive The National Medal of Arts, which was presented by President Obama.\nGlaser s artwork has been featured in solo exhibitions, including in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, Lincoln Center Gallery, Houghton Gallery, and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art; in Boston at the Art Institute in Boston; in Italy at the Vicenza Museum, Nuages Gallery, the Galleria Comunale d Arte Moderna in Bologna, and Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa in Venice; in Japan at Japan s Creation Gallery and the Suntory Museum; and in Paris at the Centre Georges Pompidou. Glaser is represented in permanent collections in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, The Chase Manhattan Bank, and the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum; in Washington D.C. at the National Archive, Smithsonian Institute; and in Jerusalem at The Israel Museum."

This exceptional collection will be comprised of pieces that range in size from 3 x 4 inches to 8 \u00bd x 11 inches. \u00a0Also on view and for sale will be large wood panels 66 x 33 inches for $14,000 each. Preston s highly sought-after pieces will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, and will only be available at SMMoA during this special pop-up studio sale.\n There is a unique quality to trees, with each one having its own beauty and personality,  explains Preston.  Many cultures have myths about sacred trees. The Japanese tradition of planting trees as a possible dwelling space for good spirits inspired this project, as did my fascination with wood itself playing with the idea of wood, wood grain, and using wood as a  canvas . \nA long-time member and supporter of SMMoA, Preston will generously donate up to 70% of proceeds to support the Museum s exhibition, education, and outreach programs.\nPreston (b. 1945) was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and lives and works in Santa Monica. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature from the University of California, Los Angeles.\nPreston s work has been presented in numerous solo exhibitions in museums and galleries, including Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach; Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art; Wichita Falls Museum   Art Center, Texas; Ella Sharp Museum, Jackson, Michigan; Saginaw Art Museum, Michigan; Craig Krull Gallery, Santa Monica; Peter Blake Gallery, Laguna Beach; Jan Turner Gallery, Los Angeles; Gallery Foret Noire, Takamatsu, Japan; and Lux Art Institute, Encinitas, California. Her work has been shown in group exhibitions at San Diego Museum of Art; Long Beach Museum of Art; Orange County Center for Contemporary Art; Design Center of Los Angeles; Schneider Museum of Art, Ashland, Oregon; Bakersfield Museum of Art; McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, Texas; Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans; New York Academy of Fine Arts; and Korea and Tong Art Museum, Taegu, Korea."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Georgi Tushev: Strange Attractor presents paintings and a work on paper that investigate the effects of oil paint when exposed to extreme magnetic fields. Tushev s signature works explore the dynamism of pigment, the physical possibilities of paint, and the transformation of matter. He uses pigments that contain high concentrations of iron that, when exposed to magnets, create textured, three-dimensional surfaces, where paint seemingly explodes off the picture plane. Tushev s works on paper are made through a similar technique, though in water, where the magnetic fields separate the watercolor pigments into areas of black, white, and gray and create concentric rings and circular patterns.\nTushev s abstract pictorial space is evocative of natural forms and biological processes. On the macro level, the work appears geological, celestial like lunar terrain. On the micro level, it suggests a view from under the microscope of cell division and mitosis. Tushev s method is inherently experimental; his compositions are subject to varying degrees of chance and instability. His long-time scientific testing of material has resulted in works that are arresting in form and astonishing in process.\nStrange Attractor is the first Los Angeles show for Tushev and his debut museum exhibition; it also marks the inauguration of NY\/LA, the Museum s new exhibition series that connects contemporary art on both coasts. Strange Attractor is organized by New York-based curator Jeffrey Uslip.\nTushev (b. 1969) was born in Bulgaria and lives and works in New York City. He earned a graduate degree from the National Academy of Fine Arts, Sofia, Bulgaria, and completed a residency at the Santa Fe Art Institute, New Mexico, and a Master Class of Painting in Amsterdam with painter Markus Lupertz.\nTushev s work has been represented in solo exhibitions in San Francisco at Noma Gallery and in Sofia, Bulgaria, at XXL Gallery.\nSupport for Georgi Tushev: Strange Attractor has been provided in part by Peter Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles.\n \nNY\/LA: A New, Annual Exhibition Series"

        "DESCRIPTION":"Kelly Barrie: Mirror House is a new, large-format photographic work created especially for Project Room 1 at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Including drawing, dance, performance, and digital collage, Barrie s work investigates the relationship between historical memory and aesthetic practice in this case, using Hurricane Katrina as the backdrop.\nBarrie uses images of the effects of traumatic events as his artistic source material. Mirror House began with a found photograph of a flooded house and tree from New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. The ghost image of the scene evokes a dreamscape rather than a pictorial representation of a calamity. The end result is a poignant, Surrealist-like mural that transforms a real-life disaster into a disorienting but beautiful reverie.\nBarrie s multi-dimensional process combines many artistic genres. He  performs  his response to found photographs on his studio floor by literally drawing the image with his feet, dragging photo-luminescent pigment on black paper with toe drags, heel spins, snake walks, and foot sweeps. He then photographs his  drawing  with a 35 mm camera utilizing natural daylight stored in the light-sensitive powder. The powder s light is released by using the vertical blinds in the studio as a type of aperture. More than seventy photographs were taken with a grid system to document the drawing. Barrie then digitally stitched these photographs together to construct the finished work which is both haunting and painterly.\nThis exhibition has been supported by David Knaus. Special thanks to Michael Maloney."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Beatrice Wood: Career Woman\u2013Drawings, Paintings, Vessels, and Objects offers a comprehensive survey and a new assessment of this emblematic California artist a scholarly, commemorative evaluation of Wood, whose extraordinary life and career traversed and contributed to the cultural and artistic highlights of the entire 20th century. SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.\nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.\nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.\nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.\nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.\nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

        "DESCRIPTION":"The Dark Lining, Marco Brambilla s first solo museum exhibition, features seven major time-based works from 1999 to the present. Brambilla s oeuvre consists of complex video installations. Much of his work comprises found film footage edited, layered, and spliced to create compelling new narratives and stunning visual mosaics. With exquisite technical production and seamless editing, Brambilla s multi-layered tableaux of interconnecting images and looped video blend into an expansive landscape that forms his hallmark style.\nThe exhibition at SMMoA will feature the premier of Evolution (Megaplex), 2010, a new large-scale 3D video collage, which displays the history of humankind through the lens of cinema. In this never before seen work, Brambilla combines hundreds of clips from genre films that re-enact historical moments as grand spectacle. This cacophony of images is looped and mapped into an infinite three-dimensional environment that scrolls horizontally across time. Evolution emphasizes conflicts through the ages, in a remix that seamlessly moves through past, present, and future, providing a satirical take on the bombast of the big-budget  epic. \nIn a poignant work from 2002 titled HalfLife, Brambilla juxtaposes surveillance footage of gamers playing the then-popular video game Counter-Strike with live-feed footage of the game they are playing. By placing the young men in the  cross-hairs  point-of-view while simultaneously capturing their virtual actions inside the game-world, Brambilla highlights the physical displacement and the psychological dislocation inherent in entering the digital world.\nCathedral, 2008, in which Brambilla filmed Christmas shoppers in a Canadian mall, exposes raw footage in a long and slow sequence of kaleidoscopic patterning. The superimposed and multi-layered images transform the mall into a hallucinatory space. Though it resembles an animated stained glass window, the work depicts commerce and conspicuous consumption, and the conflation of a  shoppers  paradise  with a literal place of worship.\nBrambilla s Civilization (Megaplex), 2008, is dense with imagery and depicts heaven, hell, and in-between, in an epic, almost Dante-esque style, set to an excerpt from Stravinsky s Rite of Spring.\u00a0 His first  video mural  integrates clips into an expansive landscape that continuously scrolls downward, starting with the fires of hell, progressing through to celestial reward. Other works in the exhibition include Wall of Death, 2001; Sync, 2005; and Sea of Tranquility, 2006.\nThe ambitious installation design of The Dark Liningwill mirror Brambilla s complex visual arrangements where the viewer is led, almost transported, from singular, theater-like stations to open spaces where multiple works present themselves in layered concert with one another. The exhibition at SMMoA is unique from previous installations as this will present multiple significant works from the last decade and illustrate Brambilla s artistic range and evolution. The exhibition itself, therefore, will function as an artwork one that is revealed with the audience s choreographed movement through a well-orchestrated and articulated space.\nMarco Brambilla studied film at Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, and then worked in commercials and feature films, directing the successful 1993 science fiction film Demolition Man. In 1998, he shifted his focus to video and photography projects as an artist and filmmaker. His work has been exhibited internationally at such institutions as the Kunsthalle Bern, screened at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals, and can be found in the permanent collections of the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, and the ARCO Foundation in Madrid, amongst others. Brambilla has been awarded both the Tiffany Comfort Foundation and Colbert Foundation awards for his video installations. He was born in Milan, Italy, and currently lives and works in New York and Los Angeles.\nMajor support for this exhibition has been provided by The Chaney Family Collection, Beth Rudin DeWoody, and Liz Swig. Additional support has been provided by HSI Productions and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Al Taylor: Wire Instruments and Pet Stains is the first American survey of work by this important and prolific artist. The exhibition features two major series in Taylor s vast oeuvre: Wire Instruments (1989-1990) and Pet Stains (1989-1992). These distinctive bodies of work will illustrate the importance of Taylor s process and creative breadth.\nTaylor was born in Springfield, Missouri in 1948. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and moved to New York in 1970, where he lived and worked until his death at the age of 51 from lung cancer in 1999. Taylor worked for many years as studio assistant to Robert Rauschenberg (where he met his future wife Debbie) and was acquainted with such burgeoning luminaries as James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly, and Brice Marden. Although these relationships nourished Taylor s abundant talent, his future work was inspired but not defined by these friendships. Out of financial necessity, he scavenged art materials from the street. His connection with the commonplace which remained unpredictable and deep resulted in a body of work that is singular, inventive, and eloquent.\nTaylor began his studio practice as a painter in the seventies and early eighties. By 1985, however, he had developed a unique approach to process that encompassed a synergistic relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional assemblages. Taylor s goal was to create a new way to experience and envision space; the works from this period helped him refine his investigations of visual perception across several dimensions.  Al felt that his work was research into vision,  says Debbie Taylor.  His work is really about looking, but he used everything around him. Seeing something could lead him to making one of these pieces, that could combine with something that he d read that morning, or with some music playing on the stereo, or with something on TV. Any of those things could inspire him. \nTaylor made no distinction between his three-dimensional constructions and his drawings. Dismissing the term  sculpture,  he preferred to see the 3-D work as  drawing in space.  Fashioned from such simple elements as wooden broomsticks, wire, carpentry remnants, and other ephemera, his constructions offer a multitude of distinct points of view. Taylor s drawings, in fact, often inspired the development of his three-dimensional works, which he created as an extension, in order to  see more.  Taylor remarked that  [the work] isn t at all about sculptural concerns; it comes from a flatter set of traditions. What I am really after is finding a way to make a group of drawings that you can look around. Like a pool player, I want to have all the angles covered. \nThe drawings and constructions titled Wire Instruments show Taylor experimenting with the simplest variations of geometric form (especially the triangle). These fragile ink, pencil, and gouache drawings and wood and wire constructions have not been the focus of any previous exhibitions or scholarly investigation. Their simplicity and ephemeral beauty provide a poignant glimpse into Taylor s creative production.\nThe body of work called Pet Stains (which includes Pet Stains, Pet Names, Pet Stain Removal Devices, and the Peabody Group) portrays sensuous, abstract imagery of drop-like puddles, formulated with toner, paint, or ink on paper. The constructions in this series are made from wood and Plexiglas that is dribbled and dripped with paint of every viscosity. In this series, Taylor transformed patterns of dog urine on an urban sidewalk into art. The playful ease and subtle humor of these works is apparent: various pee-stains are often tagged with imaginary names of the dogs\/artists who made them Buddy, Norman, Getty, Goya, and Everready or, with a nod to Duchamp, given such titles as Puddle Descending a Staircase, and so on. Again, as in Wire Instruments, permutation and variation on the theme is integral to his process how many pet names, how many puddles of pee can he transform into nuanced drawings or quirky constructions.\nWire Instruments and Pet Stains will include 47 works. Connie Butler, The Robert Lehman Foundation Chief Curator of Drawings at the Museum of Modern Art, will contribute a major essay to accompany the exhibition.\nMajor support for the exhibition is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation. Additional support is provided by the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, Susan and Leonard Nimoy, and David Zwirner, New York."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Hey mister, which way to the donkey show?\nIf you don t like the picture, blame the ass.\nFor over a century, millions of Americans have put on sombreros and posed for tourist photographs on top of donkeys in the border city of Tijuana, Mexico. For almost as long, one of the greatest urban legends in all of California history has been the Tijuana donkey show, the much-rumored, often-referenced, but never proven south of the border sex show that is perpetually re-invented in American high school locker rooms. The Donkey Show explores the border s intersection of myth and reality through a blend of over 200 rare tourist photographs, vintage nightlife ephemera, and pop songs born of American myths of Tijuana. The exhibition is guest curated by cultural anthropologist and graphic design historian Jim Heimann and author and music critic Josh Kun.\nThe Donkey Show, one of the greatest urban legends in all of border history has been a key narrative of the American tourist since WWII. It has been referenced in songs, Hollywood films, and for decades has lurked in the dark corners of American fantasies about what lies just below the borderline-that capital of boundless vice and sombrero-clad savagery where morals drown in tequila, men offer their wives and sisters for the right price, and where only the taxi drivers (those tour guides of the forbidden) know the way to the donkey show. The myth of the donkey show proliferated as Tijuana s reputation as a den of ill repute grew in the American mind, from U.S. sex comics such as Tijuana Bibles and early U.S. smut films set in Tijuana, to local burlesque and prostitution houses. The trip to Tijuana soon became a rite of passage for California teenagers, memorialized in movies such as Big Wednesday and Losin  It (which featured Tom Cruise leading the Tijuana charge) and TV shows such as Moesha and The OC.\nThe other donkey is the one that the millions of tourists who ve visited Tijuana actually get to know. That donkey is the one they sit on top of wearing sombreros lettered with  Just Married,   On My Ass,  and  Still Drunk  in front of a painted backdrop of  Old Mexico,  posing for souvenir photographs snapped by the Mexican entrepreneurs who ve been putting smiling Americans atop donkeys-day in, day out-since the turn of the 20th century. That donkey is a source of local business; that donkey is a local joke on American tourists looking for  the real thing  and getting Mexican make-believe.\nBeginning in the late 1880s, Tijuana was fertile soil for American investment and American tourism, an early hub of hot springs, horse races, casinos and bullfights that exploded once Prohibition went into effect. American newspaper, railroad, and entertainment moguls poured money into the small dusty town (in 1900, Tijuana had a population of only 242) that was a short carriage ride from San Diego, creating a haven for vices unattainable on the opposite side of the border. Americans crossed the border to lose themselves in a fun house of racial stereotypes, seeing  native dances  and cock fights, donning serapes and sombreros, and posing with donkeys before they headed back home. It didn t take long for Tjuana locals to start cashing in on the distortions that Americans were expecting to find, giving the tourists want they wanted to see:  old Mexico,   the sleepy Mexican,  the Spanish se\u00f1orita, the fat mustachioed bandido. By 1938, the Mexicans who ran the donkey cart photo stands began to paint black stripes on their animal stars so they could be better seen on the increasingly inferior film stock. Ever since, not only have millions of tourists sat on top of donkeys posing as  Mexicans,  they ve sat on top of  zonkeys  posing as  Mexicans. \nThe striped donkey has become something of an official Tijuana mascot, lending its name and image to local bars, local industry, and as of 2010, even to a new city basketball team (Los Zonkeys).  The striped donkey is characteristic of the city,  Tijuana journalist Aida Silva Hernandez once wrote,  It is the history of Tijuana. \nThe Donkey Show assembles over 200 tourist donkey cart photos from the early 1900s-1980s (one that even includes F. Scott Fitzgerald), alongside rare Tijuana nightlife, burlesque, and vice ephemera. The images are joined by a soundtrack culled from dozens of US pop, rock, and blues songs about the imaginary Mexico that awaits American tourists once they head south of the border. Like the donkey show of legend, The Donkey Show plays with the power of the border s bait and switch: the show promises the forbidden but delivers cultural history and critique.\nWhat has driven millions of Americans of all backgrounds-white, Black, Latino, young, old-to have their picture taken on a donkey for well over a century? How have Mexican entrepreneurs turned American myth into local business and local culture? In a photo of a tourist and a donkey, which one is the ass?\nAnd most importantly, how do you get to the donkey show?\nBiographies of the guest curators:\nJim Heimann is a cultural anthropologist and graphic design historian who is Executive Editor for TASCHEN America. He is the author of numerous books on architecture, pop culture, and the history of the West Coast, Los Angeles and Hollywood. The Donkey Show draws heavily from his private collection of ephemera that has been featured in museum exhibitions around the world and in dozens of books.\nJosh Kun is an author, music critic, and professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, where he directs the Popular Music Project of The Norman Lear Center. He has taught and written extensively on the cultural worlds connecting Southern California and Tijuana, Mexico."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Daniel Cummings: Recent Paintings is the artist s first museum exhibition. Cummings (b. 1980) is a graduate of the MFA program at UCLA in sculpture, where he transferred his interest in 3-dimensional objects to painting. His abstract work plays with space and color in a variety of scales. The result: Deceptively simple, formal compositions that belie complex figure\/ground relationships.\nThis exhibition will feature six new works that investigate surface and pictorial depth, as well as the space between abstraction and figuration. In works like Metro, figures seem to emerge from shadowy environments, alluding to deep space and movement. Works like Untitled-with its central, ghostly, soft pink blur placed on background shapes in orange, blue, white, and black-deftly combine loose and semi-transparent washes with carefully wrought pictorial structure. Born in Pittsburgh, he lives and works in Los Angeles."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Libro\/Oggetto: Italian Artists  Books 1960s-Now presents a concise history of Italian art through the form of the artist s book. The artist s book is extremely varied in the imagery, language, medium, and content embraced by its author and the wide range of examples selected for this exhibition emphasizes the possibilities of the genre. In many instances, in fact, the included works do not conform to the traditional structure of a book, or, for that matter, to any conventional art object. They are a hybrid form: book\/art\/object. Conceived as a complement to Combustione: Alberto Burri and America, Libro\/Oggetto features works by Burri s contemporaries and successors, creating a contextual framework for his production.\nLibro\/Oggetto includes work by 49 artists working in a wide array of artistic movements. For example, the Visual Poetry artists of the 1960s and  70s used the book inventively to explore the combination of text and image. Arte Povera, which erupted from within a consumer society marked by mass production, sought to create work with  poor means.  For these artists, the book became a vehicle for constructing a new, raw visual vocabulary with everyday materials. During the late 1970s and early  80s, the Transavanguardia movement dramatically expanded the definition of painting. For those artists, the book was the perfect format in which to show their new brand of figuration and narrative.\nA generation of young artists continues to work with this form, expanding upon the trails blazed by their forebears. Libro\/Oggetto illustrates the rich diversity inherent in the artist s book, revealing the artistic trends of Italian art over the past 50 years.\nLibro\/Oggetto: Italian Artists  Books 1960s-Now\u00a0features works by: Giovanni Anselmo, Stefano Arienti, Mirella Bentivoglio, Alighiero Boetti, Alberto Burri, Luca Buvoli, Chiara Camoni, Paolo Canevari, Loriana Castano, Maurizio Cattelan, Sandro Chia, Giuseppe Chiari, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Gino de Dominicis, Nicola De Maria, Mario Diacono, Luciano Fabro, Giovanni Ferrario, Emilio Isgr\u00f2, Jannis Kounellis, Ketty La Rocca, Andrea Marescalchi, Amedeo Martegani, Luigia Martelloni, Fabio Mauri, Mario Merz, Eugenio Miccini, Bruno Munari, Maurizio Nannucci, Luigi Ontani, Pierpaolo Pagano, Mimmo Paladino, Luca Pancrazzi, Giulio Paolini, Claudio Parmiggiani, Pino Pascali, Giuseppe Penone, Luciano Perna, Lucia Pescador, Lamberto Pignotti, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Pedro Riz a Porta, Ettore Spalletti, Allessandra Spranzi, Mauro Staccioli, Ernesto Tatafiore, and Emilio Villa.\nLibro\/Oggetto: Italian Artists  Books 1960s-Now was organized by guest curators\u00a0Giovanna Zamboni Paulis and Randi Malkin Steinberger.\u00a0\nSupport for the exhibition has been provided by Fondazione Azzurra. Additional support is provided by the Istituto Italiano di Cultura (IIC), Los Angeles."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Andrew Lord is a British artist working in New York and the Netherlands, who, from his earliest exhibitions in the late 1970s, has explored sculptural and pictorial concerns through clay, plaster, beeswax, bronze, video, drawing, and printmaking. Lord s work transforms sensation into physical form charged with emotion, reflection, physical identity, and personal history.\nIn Lord s exhibition for SMMoA, elements from five series of works represent developments in his oeuvre from the 1990s to the present day. Breathing, biting, swallowing, tasting, smelling, listening, watching is a landmark series of forms (1992-1998) in which Lord transforms abstract sensation into material form by molding his own body into clay with repeated applications of his chest, teeth, neck, nostrils, ears and eyes. By using his body as a tool, he translates the senses hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling from their liminal states into tactile and visual objects. In another series round, modeling, marking, touching and holding, pressing and squeezing, palm, fist Lord explores the sculptural variations made by the actions and gestures of his hands.\nIn untitled series (2004), Lord observes and rebuilds the ceramics of Paul Gauguin, who has been a pivotal influence for him since the 1970s. Lord s untitled series explores Gauguin s enigmatic narrative in clay, of figures emerging from a natural landscape or engaged in everyday activity.\nMore recently in Whitworth (2009), Lord built a series of clay sculptures that record the monuments, landscapes and people of his birthplace Whitworth, in Lancashire, England. In these works he uses memory as a sense in itself, giving it three-dimensional form. By imbuing the act of remembering with corporeal potential, Lord creates a sculptural map of the town, navigating his personal history through the recognizable landmarks of Whitworth s geography. Lord is also creating river Spodden at Healey Dell, a new series of plaster and beeswax sculptures that depict abstracted elements of the river on its rocky course through Whitworth. A video of the same name, made in 2008, accompanies the sculptures.\nLord studied at Rochdale College of Art, England and later at the Central School of Art and Design, London. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; and The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA. Lord has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Art   Project, Amsterdam; The Carnegie Museum of Art; Camden Arts Centre, London; and Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. His work has been included in Westkunst-Heute at the Museen dr Stadt, K\u00f6ln; the 1995 Whitney Biennial; Site and Insight at PS1, New York; and The Third Mind at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.\nSMMoA is collaborating with Milton Keynes Gallery in England on the production of a major catalogue that features an interview between Lord and James Rondeau (Curator, Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Contemporary Art, The Art Institute of Chicago), and an essay by independent curator and scholar, Linda Norden. The combined exhibitions at SMMoA and Milton Keynes Gallery will comprise a comprehensive survey of Lord s work.\nThe exhibition curator for Andrew Lord: between my hands to water falling, selected works from 1990 to 2010 is Elsa Longhauser, SMMoA Executive Director.\nMajor support is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Abby Sher, the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, and Gladstone Gallery"

This year, SMMoA s Park Studio collaborates with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA, which runs from April 15 to June 30, 2010. An exhibition of student work inspired by the themes of Richard Wagner s opera, Der Ring des Nibelungen, entitled Park Studio: RING, will be on view at SMMoA from May 15 through August 21, 2010. Park Studio is developed and organized by Asuka Hisa, SMMoA`s Director of Education.\nThis summer, LA Opera unveils the first complete performances of Richard Wagner`s Ring Cycle ever presented in Los Angeles. In celebration of this monumental event, LA Opera has joined forces with Los Angeles  cultural and educational institutions to stage the first significant citywide cultural festival since the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. SMMoA s partnership with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA aligns with the goals of the Park Studio program.\nFor Park Studio: RING, approximately twenty high school students will learn about Richard Wagner s seminal work and explore the symbolism of the ring in the opera power, jealousy, desire which has parallels in today s culture. They will participate in Ring Cycle discussions with SMMoA s educators, collaborating artists, and guest speakers, visit the backstage of the LA Opera, and enjoy a dress rehearsal of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Finally, with the help of environmental artist Gordon Bowen and his Arts ReFoundry Atelier (a portable foundry made completely from recycled materials), students will interpret the meaning and power of the ring to cast their own original bronze ring-shaped sculptures. The exhibition of the student s bronze works will be displayed at SMMoA from May 15 to August 21, 2010.\nPark Studio takes interdisciplinary art education outside museum walls and into the community. This free program is held annually during the spring break, when contemporary artists lead workshops, art history lessons, and field trips to cultural sites. Park Studio is open to high school students residing or attending school in the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District. Students enrolled at Santa Monica`s Olympic High School, a continuation school, may receive a full semester credit toward earning their high school diploma. SMMoA presents this program in partnership with the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Department and the Teen Center at Virginia Avenue Park.\nFor over 10 years, Park Studio has provided unforgettable and formative experiences for teens. Through transformative experiences of art making and collaboration with established artists and organizations, participants gain access to ideas and opportunities that have the potential to shape their adult lives."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Working in film, video, and installation, Diana Thater has been an innovator in her medium for 20 years and is best known for creating complex visual and spatial environments. Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.\nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.\nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth. Between Science and Magic is Thater s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in over 10 years.\nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Broad Art Foundation, The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation, and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation."

His video projections are participatory performances that use light, time and optics to create an element of surprise. For Seeing While Seeing, Wells will create a series of new, site-specific, projected works that mimic a variety of visual phenomena from after-effects and aura to color and shape-shifts the room will literally come alive with his animated projections. Each work makes you question whether what you see is real or is just an animated effect.\nWells received his M.F.A from UCLA in 2006, and lives and works in Joshua Tree, California."

        "DESCRIPTION":"SMMoA presents the United States premier of Sabbath 2008, a video which documents the closing down of the ultra-orthodox neighborhoods in and around Jerusalem on the eve of the Sabbath. In most cases, public access to these neighborhoods is blocked by means of temporary barriers, which remain closed for 24 hours thus creating an artificial border between the orthodox areas and the rest of the city. The barriers are put in place by neighborhood residents, with the approval and support of the Jerusalem municipality and the police. The city therefore becomes topologically transformed into two cities one with and one without cars. Although the value of these somewhat rickety barriers may appear symbolic, their presence is sometimes a source of friction and conflict; they delineate a clear cut boundary between the sacred and the everyday. Pereg s subject matter is often full of political tension, but in Sabbath 2008, she has created a film that is objective in offering a documentary view of an important aspect of religious Jewish life.\nPereg was born in Israel in 1969, and now lives in Israel and Germany. She received her B.F.A from Cooper Union in New York, and graduated from the Bezalel M.F.A studio program in Jerusalem. Her works have been exhibited at such venues as PS 1 New York; HDK Berlin; ZKM Karlsruhe; the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art; Liverpool Biennial, England (2006); and Loop Video-Art Fair, Barcelona, Spain (2006).\nNira Pereg: Sabbath 2008 has been supported in part by The Jewish Federation s Tel Aviv\/Los Angeles Partnership."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Inspired by the conceptual art exhibition\u00a0Art By Telephone\u00a0(Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 1969), in which participants phoned in their specifications for their works of art, artists Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride will exchange instructions to create their respective artworks in their first two-person U.S. Museum exhibition.\u00a0Tell Me Something Good: A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride\u00a0opens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on September 12 and will be on view through December 5, 2009.\nThe original 1969\u00a0Art By Telephone\u00a0was curated by Jan van der Marck. Its basic premise was to invite international and out-of-state artists to phone instructions that would be executed bymuseum installers. Schoenstadt and McBride have created their  exchange  as a variation of the 1969 project, with each phoning the other with instructions for a work. At SMMoA, Schoenstadt will create McBride s work according to the instructions   photographs of all the gas stations along California Highway 1 between Los Angeles International Airport and Point Dume. McBride was asked by Schoenstadt to choose a discarded drawing from her studio and load it into a fax machine, then ask the Gallery to fax the floor plans of their proposed exhibition space. The combination of interposed drawing and architectural plan provided the final composition. This work was shown at New York gallery Alexander and Bonin from May 9 through June 13, 2009.\nThe project takes up the  telephone game  idea of transforming visual information into language and back to visual, and also embraces the conceptual promise that  anyone  can make an art work based on the idea of the systemic production of art according to instruction. In the current era of instant messaging and social media, Schoenstadt and McBride use the telephone as a means of communication to initiate their conceptual works that explore the ramifications of what happens when an artist gives up control over his or her project. With its focus on collaboration and exploration of the nature of authorship, this exhibition is the perfect complement to the Allen Ruppersberg exhibition, which runs concurrently at SMMoA.\nSchoenstadt received a BFA from Pitzer College, California, and has participated in many solo and two-person exhibitions and projects in Europe and the U.S., including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, London. Her body of work centers around the exploration of drawing, and frequently includes series in which the final product is arrived at by chance or by instructions provided either via the audience or other artists; her works are often site-specific. Schoenstadt lives and works in Venice, California.\nMcBride received a BA from Bard College, New York, and an MFA from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia. She is the recipient of many awards and residencies, including the prestigious Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2002). Her projects vary greatly from unorthodox books to large-scale sculptures. Her work has been shown at the SculptureCenter, New York, and she has had several solo museum exhibitions throughout Europe. McBride lives and works in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany where she is a professor at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf.\nThe catalog accompanying the project is a recording of each artist s instructions on a vinyl record, just as it was for the original 1969\u00a0Art By Telephone. The record will be playing in the Project Room as part of the installation; a limited edition of signed copies will be available for sale.\u00a0Tell Me Something Good: A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride\u00a0is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art and curator Lisa Melandri, Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs."

        "DESCRIPTION":"In her first West Coast Museum exhibition, artist Nicole Cherubini presents new sculptures that reference the history of clay as a medium and feature forms made of terracotta, earthenware, and porcelain and surfaces arrived at through various hand-built, thrown and molded processes. New forms are accompanied and supported by materials such as wood, MDF, 2x3s, digital photographs, metal, glaze, enamel, and drawing materials.\nCherubini s work brings antiquated notions of ceramics into a contemporary sculptural discourse as they invoke ideas rooted in conceptual art from the 1970s. The new  box  pieces presented at SMMoA come from a continued interest by Cherubini in movement, process, containment, and structure. These sculptures reference the cardboard pieces of Robert Rauschenberg, the material use of Robert Morris, ideas about physical space addressed by Donald Judd, and Eva Hesse s ability to challenge the 2-D and 3-D.\nCherubini s large container is based on a Greek storage vessel from 500BC in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Made of clay in multiple sections, it has no base and is filled with holes in defiance of its function. Barely glazed, most of its surface is raw, exposed, dry clay.\nAttached to this sculpture is a framed manipulated digital c-print of an 18th Century watercolor of The Portland Vase by T. Hosner Shepard. This vase, in the collection of The British Museum, London, was famously broken in February 1845 by an Irish university drop-out, William Mulcahy, who destroyed the vitrine and smashed the vase with a stone sculpture displayed nearby. Cherubini has drawn over this image with paint, graphite, and ink, depicting the shards before the piece was reconstructed.\nCherubini uses the cardboard box in which manufactured clay comes as a mold for an object placed on a tall pedestal base. The collapsed, flaccid  box  is turned on its flattened side, adorned with pools and drips of glaze. Marks created by the mold and finger fully illustrate the process of its making, exposing both inside and out to the viewer.\nA large plywood pilaster, full of knots and cracks, displays brightly glazed hanging terracotta  boxes . These are glazed with intense semi-precious colors of lapis, turquoise, malachite, cobalt, and rose quartz. Their earthy and organic textures vary from high gloss to matte, and are texturized with shimmery sediment and crystals mixing in the firing process. A larger 5-sided clay  box  stands on its side nearby, made from white clay with a matte white glaze.\nCherubini was born in Boston in 1970. She received her BFA in Ceramics from the Rhode Island School of Design and her MFA in Visual Arts from New York University, and later attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. She is a recipient of an NEA Travel Grant, a New England Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Sculpture, the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award, and most recently an Art Matters Grant for travel in Mexico.

        "DESCRIPTION":"The Santa Monica Museum of Art presents\u00a0Allen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take.\u00a0Among the first generation of American conceptual artists that also includes John Baldessari, Douglas Huebler, and Bruce Nauman who redefined artistic practice during the 1970s, this exhibition features two new major interactive installations created especially for the occasion.\u00a0Allen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take\u00a0opens on September 12 and continues through December 19, 2009.\n We are delighted to present this exhibition at SMMoA,  states Elsa Longhauser, Executive Director.  Al is a  vernacular anthropologist  whose artistic interests and sensibilities have been indelibly shaped by the spirit and ethos of Southern California. \nRuppersberg s vast oeuvre includes paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, installations and books that explore the intersection of art, literature, and life. His work is often participatory, like that of Allan Kaprow and others, and he finds source material in the everyday. Ruppersberg s vast collection of early to mid-twentieth-century cultural ephemera-which includes calendars, snapshots, magazines, comic books, newspaper clippings, postcards, posters, and instructional films-form the basis of much of his recent work.\nAs a teacher and artist, Ruppersberg has also influenced several Los Angeles artists of the generation following his, including, most notably, Jim Shaw and Mike Kelley, whose works also deal with the American vernacular. East Coast artist Rachel Harrison, who incorporates a deluge of cultural debris in her sculptures-celebrity magazines, costume jewelry, canned goods, and wigs-has acknowledged Ruppersberg s importance in the development of her own work. Ruppersberg has always had a strong, independent vision shaped first by growing up in America s heartland and also by spending months and years living and working in New York and Europe, where his work has been shown in an array of major museums.\nTwo new large-scale installations in this exhibition continue to expand Ruppersberg s use of imagery culled from his vast archive of twentieth-century ephemera.\u00a0The Never Ending Book Part 2\/Art and Therefore Ourselves\u00a0(2009), is a selection of more than 15,000 pages of Xeroxed images from the artist s book collection, installed in a stage-like environment made of theatrical props and early twentieth-century mural-sized vintage posters. The pages are stacked in approximately fifty small cardboard boxes designed by the artist. These duplicated pages are free for the taking. In this way, Ruppersberg makes his library available to each audience member who can subsequently create his or her own unique  book  to take home. As part of this project, Ruppersberg has created a 33 RPM vinyl LP record, which functions as an oral analog to the books on view. The record includes old songs and hymns, spoken word recordings, recipes read by poet Bill Berkson, and people singing around the piano, all dating from the early to mid-20th century.\nFor the second installation,\u00a0The Sound and the Story\/The Hugo Ball Award for 20th Century Graphics\u00a0(2009), photocopied and laminated items of everyday ephemera from Ruppersberg s extensive collection are suspended from a wall of pegboards. Viewers are invited to rearrange the materials on the pegboard to create their own narrative. During the run of the exhibition, Ruppersberg will periodically respond to these arrangements by reorganizing the items himself, thus creating a visual conversation with his audience  co-producers. \nThe exhibition also includes a selection of earlier collages and drawings-two-dimensional works from important series\u00a0The Gift and the Inheritance\u00a0(1989), and\u00a0Cover Art\u00a0(1985); both of which provide an historical backdrop to the new installations.\nRuppersberg s work is held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\u00a0He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.\nAllen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take\u00a0is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Guest curator of the exhibition is Constance Lewallen, Adjunct Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.\nThe publication that accompanies the exhibition was conceived by Ruppersberg as an artwork in itself, and is a cross between a traditional catalog and an artist s book. Based on a 1956 edition of travel guideThe Guest Informant,\u00a0it is spiral-bound and cardboard-covered. The publication contains essays by renowned author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus, and guest curator Constance Lewallen, along with an interview with and commentary on the artist, random ephemera, and exhibition information. It is co-published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland. The new vinyl LP record will also be available in a limited edition of 200.\nMajor support for the exhibition and publication is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding is provided by LLWW Foundation, the Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation, the Pasadena Art Alliance, and Margo Leavin Gallery. Related programming is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, Emily Fisher Landau, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, and Judy and Stuart Spence."

        "DESCRIPTION":"The renowned artist s first career retrospective highlights his paintings from 1964 to 2007. While Hendricks has worked in a variety of media throughout his career, and has explored diverse subject matter, he is best known for his striking and provocative life-sized portraits of everyday African-American people from the urban northeast. Bringing to mind American realism, pop culture, and post-modernism in a way uniquely his own, Hendricks  pioneering contributions to African-American portraiture and conceptualism claims a compelling space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz, and African-American conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. At times cool, at times confrontational, sometimes sexually charged, and always empowering, the work reveals the artist s keen eye for his subject s attire, attitude, style, and point of view. Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.\nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.\nBirth of the Cool\u00a0is organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the\u00a0http:\/\/www.nasher.duke.edu\/exhibitions_hendricks.php\u00a0in Durham, North Carolina.\nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.\nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. It was also shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem.\nBorn in Philadelphia, the artist studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before receiving his B.F.A and M.F.A. at Yale University, where he studied with legendary photographer Walker Evans. He is currently a Professor of Art Studio at Connecticut College, in New London, Connecticut.\nBirth of the Cool has been named one of\u00a0Vogue Magazine s\u00a0top 25 cultural events of the year.\n \nThe exhibition was organized by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.\nThis exhibition is sponsored in part by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., the National Endowment for the Arts, which believes that a great nation deserves great art, the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, and the North Carolina Arts Council with funding from the State of North Carolina.\nSupport for the presentation at SMMoA is generously provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton.

        "DESCRIPTION":"In his first museum exhibition, Khalif Kelly presents a new series of paintings based on vignettes from imaginary fairy tale adventures that portray children interacting with an array of weird and wonderful protagonists. With a fresh and vivid palette, a reductive, cartoon-like figurative style with a metallic-like patina reminiscent of video game robots and characters, Kelly creates scenes that on closer inspection reveal a mixture of personal archetypes and classic racial stereotypes.\nThe artist s aesthetic includes references to the figurative work of Jacob Lawrence and to the controversial stop motion animations of George Pal, especially\u00a0John Henry and the Inky-Poo\u00a0and the\u00a0Jasperseries from the 1940s. Like Pal, Kelly utilizes the perception of race as a narrative device, something to work with and work against in the children s formation of identity through play.\nKelly was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1980 and grew up in Arlington, Texas. He received his B.F.A. in Painting from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and his M.F.A. from Yale University. The artist lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut, and also works in New York.\n \nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton."

        "DESCRIPTION":"In her first West Coast museum exhibition, Jeni Spota brings contemporary elements to classical themes in her paintings, exploring traditional, often religious, imagery, in a new way. Through her small canvases, the viewer is able to peer into another world, watching epic scenes play out with a surreal, impressionistic twist.\nIn this exhibition, which includes new work, Spota fills her canvases with cramped figures engaged in frenzied activity, complete with choruses of angels, rows of haloed figures, and the Virgin floating, often repeatedly, in a mandorla, creating a heavy, purposeful yet intimate connection with the viewer that is rarely found in the Medieval and Renaissance pieces that her works recall. Other canvases are more abstract in their subject matter, as if she has cut and pasted detailed elements from her works to form a new composite. Don t Tread on Me features a new bronze cast of her paintings, perfectly underscoring Spota s attention to the construction of both narrative and surface.\nAdopting the flattened pictorial space of medieval icons combined with the rich, globular application of paint, Spota creates an ecstatic, almost abstract surface through her brushstroke technique, in which paint is heaped on in indulgent, cake frosting-like daubs and layers.\nSpota was born in New York and earned her B.F.A. at State University of New York at Purchase and her M.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She lives and works in Los Angeles."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Arnold Mesches has created unabashedly figurative work for more than six decades and has emerged as a seminal figure in American painting and a remarkably fresh voice in contemporary art. In the West Coast debut of new paintings that explore the American condition,\u00a0Arnold Mesches: Coming Attractions\u00a0opens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on January 24 and will be on view through April 18, 2009.\nMesches  most recent work delves into dark periods of American history and situates them in a hauntingly contemporary landscape. His work combines an interest in twentieth century political and social conflicts with a surrealist approach to painting\u00ad offsetting frank, historical moments with rich, melodramatic dreamscapes.\nThis new exhibition of Mesches  work, curated by Lisa Melandri, SMMoA s Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs, and uniquely installed in two Project Rooms, will feature selections from his most recent series, including landscapes and interiors. Aptly titled,\u00a0Coming Attractions\u00a0alludes to the works  theatrical elements, as well as to a portent of what might be to come.\nMesches  large-scale interiors and landscape canvases, are laden with acerbic colors and vigorous brushwork. In his interiors, Mesches fills opulent concert halls and antique salons with stark reminders of social and political realities, rendered in deep blacks, austere whites, and sickly greens against the blazing colors of their surroundings. Mesches  landscapes are similarly harrowing, depicting glimpses of human existence between the trunks of decaying trees. These canvases are portraits of a disturbing, looming future, both absurd and poignant, as well as emotionally authentic.\nThe theatricality and grandeur of the paintings evoke Mesches  own history working in the movie industry during the 1940s and 50s in Los Angeles, and their skepticism and ominous sensibility harkens back to the 27 years he was subject to heavy scrutiny by the FBI for his participation in peace marches and demonstrations against McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Mesches eventually obtained his 760-page FBI file through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and turned dozens of the documents crisply typed white pages thick with black bars, dating from 1945 to 1972 into a popular and critically acclaimed art exhibition,\u00a0The FBI Files.\nThroughout his 60-plus-year career as an artist, Mesches has woven many narratives into lush and virtuosic paintings, and in\u00a0Coming Attractions\u00a0Mesches affirms that he is as potent as a painter and storyteller as ever. His life s work serves as a remarkable record of one artist s struggle to come to terms with the turmoil of the twentieth century. He has stood staunchly for using contemporary art as a vehicle for protest, a visual amplifier of societal good and evil.\nComing Attractions\u00a0also marks a homecoming for Mesches, who was born in the Bronx, grew up in Buffalo, New York, and moved to Los Angeles in 1943 to accept a scholarship at the Art Center School (now Art Center College of Design). Mesches spent nearly half his life in L.A., and came into his own here in the mid 1940s and into the 50s, becoming known and revered for his socially critical paintings and his portraits. He now resides in Gainesville, Florida. He is the recipient of many awards, including the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2002).\nMesches has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and abroad in 125 solo exhibitions and countless group shows, and his works are included in many prestigious public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Albright-Knox Museum, and the High Museum of Art. However, Mesches has still not received the global recognition or broad appreciation he so deserves for his influence and importance to the canon of contemporary art. As an antidote to this oversight, SMMoA will install Mesches  work in two Project Rooms, doubling the museum space normally allotted to such exhibitions."

        "DESCRIPTION":"From January 24 to April 18, 2009, the Santa Monica Museum of Art presents\u00a0Elias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the first survey exhibition in the United States of one of Ethiopia s most original and prolific contemporary artists. The exhibition, co-curated by Meskerem Assegued, a revered Ethiopian curator and anthropologist, and visionary theater, opera, and multi-disciplinary arts impresario, Peter Sellars, is comprised of more than 100 works in a variety of mediums, scale, and forms. A highlight of the exhibition is a series of striking thrones made of leather, wood, mud and straw, which will be integrated into conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen s final Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts staged by Sellars in mid-April.\nElias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart\u00a0will be accompanied by a film by award-winning filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) that will uniquely document the exhibition.\nUsing yarn, plastics, tattered fabric, buttons, used plastic, and bottle tops, each of the collages and stitched canvases Sime creates for\u00a0Elias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart\u00a0represent a complete essay about the current state of his surroundings. Sime s three-dimensional sculptures are made with traditional organic Ethiopian building materials such as mud and straw, as well as wood, metal, and other found objects, gathered in part by neighborhood children.\nIt was Sellars  passion for Sime s work that initially inspired SMMoA s executive director Elsa Longhauser to consider the idea of an exhibition of Sime s work. During their conversations, Sellars explained that Sime s thrones, designed to elevate and celebrate Ethiopia s street culture, so moved him that he was determined to feature the thrones in his production of Stravinsky s\u00a0Oedipus Rex\u00a0and\u00a0Symphony of Psalms, Salonen s final concerts on April 16, 17, 18 and 19. Sime originally designed the thrones for Sellars  2006 New Crowned Hope Festival, a celebration of Mozart s 250th anniversary in Vienna, Austria.\nIn\u00a0Elias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the thrones make up part of the installation piece\u00a0Min Neber, a new iteration of a series of works in which Sime addresses the dignity, wisdom and depth of the ancient indigenous cultures that are rapidly disappearing from Ethiopia. Also, displayed in a semicircle around a small ceremonial table, the installation will include five wall sculptures, made from wood, cans, leather, and stitches, as well as a short, silent video installation documenting indigenous religious practices of small villages in Ethiopia. In\u00a0Mud and Straw, small mud and straw creatures take over the gallery space. A video installation documents Sime s construction of a Gota, the traditional grain storage container found in northern Ethiopia.\nBIOGRAPHIES:\nAs a child, Elias Sime taught himself to sew, embroider, and repair furniture. He collected cast-off objects and materials, such as flattened tin cans, and fashioned them into his own creations. Today Sime still collects energetically plastic shopping bags in different colors, plastic shoes, horns from slaughtered cattle and buys some of the raw material for his work, such as buttons, at the Mercato, Addis Abeba s sprawling central market. Just as he gathers materials for making art from the markets and streets, Sim\u00e9 finds the themes for his works in the streets of Addis. He documents the lives and portraits of Ethiopians living in the Cherkos Gebeya, Legaehar and Chide Terra areas surrounding Addis Abeba, where he finds most of his working materials. Sime has deep connections with the communities he documents, in particular with the neighborhood children who bring him objects they collect from the street.\nBorn in Cherkos, outside of Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, Sime graduated from Addis Abeba University s School of Fine Art and Design with a degree in graphic design. His practice focuses mainly on collages, stitches, and three-dimensional sculpture. Sime has had numerous solo shows, and has participated in many group exhibitions including the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Peter Sellars  New Crowned Hope in Vienna, Austria; the Dak Art Biennale 2004, in Dakar, Senegal; and the Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Sim\u00e9 lives and works in Addis Ababa.\nPeter Sellars, a director of opera, theatre and film, is renowned worldwide for his innovative treatments of classical material from western and non-western traditions, and for exploring the role of the performing arts in contemporary society and his commitment to spreading artistic vision to enact change. He has served as artistic director of the Los Angeles Festival, the American National Theatre at the Kennedy Center, the Boston Shakespeare Company and the Elitch Theatre for Children in Denver. Sellars is a professor in the department of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA, where he teaches Art as Social Action and Art as Moral Action. His past teaching positions include a visiting professorship at the Center for Theatre Arts at UC Berkeley. He resides in Los Angeles.\nTrained as an anthropologist, Meskerem Assegued is the curator and founder of Addis Abeba s Zoma Contemporary Art Center. In 2006, she curated Green Flame in Vienna, Austria, part of the New Crowned Hope Festival, in which Sime participated. Assegued has served as a selection committee of the 2004 Dak Art Biennale, one of the largest contemporary art exhibitions in the world. In 2007, Assegued was on the selection committee for the African Pavilion in the 52nd Venice Biennale. She lives in Addis Abeba."

        "DESCRIPTION":"I m not a photographer. I m an artist who uses photography when the idea dictates. And I think that s okay because I m also a performance artist who makes objects, or I m an object-maker who does performances. I think these labels are less important than the ability to go in the directions I d like for each work. \n- Martin Kersels in conversation with Ian Berry, Associate Director, The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College\nFrom September 13 to December 13, 2008, Santa Monica Museum of Art presents\u00a0Martin Kersels: Heavyweight Champion, the first retrospective of this influential and pioneering Southern California artist. Spanning the years from 1994 to 2007, the exhibition includes thirty-three multimedia artworks ranging from small sculptures, to large-scale photographs, to monumental installations. Kersels has long been esteemed in Southern California artistic and academic circles, and his work is in many collections worldwide. The advent of\u00a0Heavyweight Champion\u00a0marks a timely opportunity for this 2008 Guggenheim Foundation Fellow to enjoy the broader recognition and respect his work and creative achievements so well deserve.\nKersels is a long-time aficionado of Buster Keaton, and on first encounter, his artwork seems to exude a similar deadpan slapstick style, balancing the humorous with the wistfully awkward. On further study, this initial impression gives way to darker layers; the performances and works reveal what Kersels refers to as  wink-wink humor mixed with a tragic element.  Early pieces, including the large-scale photographic series of Kersels falling, tripping, tossing people, and being smacked with assorted objects, find the artist experimenting with the creative possibilities of his 6-foot, 7-inch, 350 lb. frame. But the trajectory of Kersels  career as illuminated in\u00a0Heavyweight Champion\u00a0clearly indicates that he is not a single-issue artist; he is not, in the words of Ian Berry  the body-issue guy.  Particularly in his later work, the artist has gone in more conceptual directions, to explore themes of scale, time, space, sound, and gravity.\nHighlights of\u00a0Heavyweight Champion\u00a0include the monumental installation\u00a0Dionysian Stage\u00a0(2004-2005), a 14-foot-diameter nest that spins like an enormous, natural disco ball, and incorporates all manner of homey, domestic debris in its woven willow branches. The work evolved from Kersels  interest in utilizing traditional craft in nontraditional ways, and from his study in Sweden and Denmark with master craftspeople.\u00a0Rickety\u00a0(2007), the artist s latest work, is a sculpture that compresses and oppresses furniture and other oversized objects beneath a platform. This lower, slightly topsy-turvy world stands in sharp contrast to the clean openness of the top part of the installation. While some of the other sculptures in the exhibition act as surrogates for Kersels  physical being,\u00a0Rickety\u00a0is about the experience of the trials and tribulations of navigating a large body through the world.\nAn engaging range of programming accompanies\u00a0Heavyweight Champion, beginning with a performance by the electrifying jazz\/punk\/blues band Puttanesca on Friday, September 12, the opening night of the exhibition. The concert will take place atop\u00a0Rickety. Puttanesca s charismatic vocalist Weba Garretson was, along with Kersels, a member of the performance troupe SHRIMPS, which played a pivotal role in Kersels  development as an artist. Subsequent programming includes\u00a0Heavyweight Lecture Musicale(Tuesday, September 23), Kersels  discussion of his work utilizing visual materials, songs, music, and dance, followed by a Q A with the artist; and the dance recital\u00a0Huh?, choreographed by Melinda Ring specifically for the exhibition, and performed throughout\u00a0Rickety\u00a0(Friday and Saturday, November 14 and 15).\nHeavyweight Champion\u00a0is accompanied by a full-color catalog illustrating the scope of the artist s work. The publication includes an interview with Martin Kersels by Ian Berry, Associate Director at The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, where the exhibition debuted."

The loosely painted and often crudely unfinished surfaces give the works a riveting, tangible immediacy, like Polaroids freshly pulled from the camera. The artist s experiences with poverty and homelessness before his enrollment at CalArts compellingly inform his practice. His unique blend of academic training and outsider s sensibility results in authentic, multilayered insights into the human condition.\nTaylor s exhibition title constructs a humorous duality, at once warmly referring to his mother, sister, and female friends, while also alluding slyly to the iconic Roy Lichtenstein print,\u00a0Grrrrrrrr!, featuring an aggressive, growling dog."

Pollock presents a series of seven 24  \u00d7 24  abstract oil paintings that are monochromatic explorations of a single subject matter. He has also created an expansive, site-specific wall drawing that offers a linear interpretation of the geometric scheme used in the paintings. Both the panoramic and the more compact works reveal the artist s fascination with mathematical systems and the recurring patterns and forms found in the natural world.\nPollock animates the Project Room 2 space with fractal imagery, geometric structures, and circles, all in shifting levels of scale and density. The paintings are packed with ornate webs, honeycombs, and spirals, mimicking the logic of such organic forms as corals, mollusks, and plants. Each painting focuses on a limited color range; together the seven paintings comprise the spectrum of visible hues. The contrasting light and dark, warm and cool, and bright and dull color tones of these intense microcosms create the illusion of luminosity and deep space. The paint is applied in repeating fractal circles, producing shifting scales and intricate patterns that seem to change depending on the viewer s perspective. The wall drawing exudes a more free-flowing, outwardly directed energy. Its repeated system of patterns tumbles seemingly unimpeded towards all corners of the room, voraciously engulfing whatever surface it comes in contact with."

Participating artists included Guy Ben-Ner, Nayland Blake, Louise Bourgeois, Maurizio Cattelan, Anne Chu, Nathalie Djurberg, Terence Gower, Dan Graham, Christian Jankowski, Mike Kelley, William Kentridge, Cindy Loehr, Annette Messager, Paul McCarthy, Matt Mullican, Bruce Nauman, Dennis Oppenheim, Philippe Parreno and Rirkrit Tiravanija, Thomas Sch\u00fctte, Doug Skinner and Michael Smith, Laurie Simmons, Kiki Smith, Survival Research Laboratory, Kara Walker, and Charlie White.\nThe Puppet Show\u00a0took as its historic point of departure a great work of European avant-garde art history: Alfred Jarry s 1896 play\u00a0Ubu Roi, which was originally conceived as a puppet show. The despotic King, who strode on stage roaring the French scatological word  merdre,  is the perfect source for all puppet allegories of grotesque government and acts of puppet transgression. More recently, puppets have taken hold of popular consciousness. They show up on stage, on television, in film, and even online, where assuming a fake identity to garner public opinion is called  sock-puppeting.  Seen in correspondence with these pop culture images, the works in\u00a0The Puppet Show\u00a0advanced the question: Why do puppets matter now?\nThe Puppet Show\u00a0installation included works by participating artists as well as a collection of historic puppets, which were housed in Puppet Storage   the exhibition s simultaneous entry and  backstage  or unconsciousness."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Investigating the idea that there are impurities and  inhibitants  in our atmosphere that cause creative blockage, frustration, inefficiency, and confusion, Bruce Busby creates environments,\u00a0Creativity Enhancement Shelters, in which we can escape these negative forces and regain peace of mind and the ability to think clearly. Designed, cut, and sewn by the artist, the nylon shelters take on a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and color combinations, and appear as idiosyncratic tents. From bifurcated and curvilinear structures to objects suggesting cutting-edge teepees, Busby s shelters include transparent sections, mesh windows, and even, in some cases, a central oculus that imparts a chapel-like environment, perfect for reflection and contemplation. The structures shield their users both physically and conceptually from the vices of the urban landscape. Though sturdy, tensile, and self-supporting, all of Busby s shelters are also completely collapsible and transportable, so that one s filtration system can be taken along and erected anywhere.\nFor his first museum exhibition at SMMoA, Busby created an installation including a new large-scale shelter that is modular and can be attached to any number of other like structures through a system of quick-release buckles and zippers. While his shelters are structured around concepts of mobility and flexibility, Busby s new drawings have a geographic specificity. Included in the exhibition were a series of Busby s\u00a0Creativity Amplification Quakes (CRAQUE)\u00a0drawings, depicting intricate, billowing clouds of contamination rising from the actual fault lines of the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas. These lush, detailed renderings have a rich, almost baroque handling, belying a sinister, fluid, and pervading energy that rises from and swirls around the land. Busby began the series as a way to diagram and become intimately reacquainted with the simultaneously beautiful and dangerous California topography. By articulating the literal cracks within these particular landscapes, Busby links the work both to his Bay Area home and to the Santa Monica Museum of Art."

While Condon s previous work was characterized by the subversive tactics of hacking and the intervention into commercial computer games,\u00a0Judgment Modification\u00a0revealed his shift to composing projected moving-image installations that function as animated paintings. These noninteractive  self-playing  games run continuously, like games waiting for the viewer to pick up the controller.\nCondon s creative process is informed by the software hacking logic he learned directly from online and offline fan subcultures. In his work he often reinterprets historical events and existing artworks. Examples of this include a two-hour  Deathmatch  battle between medieval reenactors (Untitled War,\u00a02004) at Machine Project; and a computer simulation of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, featuring an AK47-wielding David Koresh (Waco Resurrection,\u00a02003, a C-level collaboration). Trained as a sculptor, Condon uses technology as the raw material for his art, creating works that are both profound and playful.\nCondon lived for a number of years in the Netherlands, where he had easy access to 15th-century European religious paintings. He believes that these works influence the visual style of games and fantasy art. He also believes that the catastrophic thinking these works reflect has greatly influenced the current political discourse.  The references to monsters and wars, the emergence of readings of the Bible, the distrust of science, the faith in religious structures to solve our problems, this type of pre-modern thinking is rooted in the late-Medieval period in northern Europe,  notes Condon."

The exhibition s labyrinth of metal and wooden studs, which conformed to the original wall constructions, revealed how the noncollecting Museum a kunsthalle reinvents itself with each new exhibition. Asher s installation translated the historical infrastructure and museological process into visual form, highlighting what would otherwise remain seamlessly hidden. The skeletal frameworks illuminated what art historian Miwon Kwon describes as  the temporariness of the architecture of temporary exhibitions.  With this work at SMMoA, Asher continued his artistic practice of institutional critique uncovering the ways in which museums and galleries display and interpret art.\nVisitors were able to view the installation from the front of the main gallery, as well as through a special entrance at the back of the museum. Project Room 2 served as a documentation room, containing floor plans for the 44 exhibitions, including the position of every wall and its exhibition provenance. In addition, a tear-away pair of handouts at the back of SMMoA allowed visitors to review all exhibition floor plans while traversing the installation.\nMichael Asher is an internationally renowned pioneer of institutional critique and conceptual art. Since the mid-1960s he has explored how museums and other institutions frame the art experience for viewers and influence the cultural dialogue. His interventions use elements that exist or existed at the site. Asher has been featured at such important venues as the Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Documenta 5 and 7, Kassel, Germany; the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland; the Kunstverein Hamburg, Germany; Le Consortium, Dijon, France; Le Nouveau Mus\u00e9e, Villeurbanne, France; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Mus\u00e9e d Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, France; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Skulptur Projekte, M\u00fcnster, Germany; the Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven, the Netherlands; and the 39th International Art Biennale, in Venice, Italy."

Her subjects are purposefully stylized to call attention to the way their real-life counterparts have been portrayed in the popular media as mysterious, exotic, sexual, even animalistic beings. Its title inspired by the Santana song of the same name,\u00a0Black Magic Woman\u00a0depicted three contemporary Santeria priestesses practicing in a spooky landscape filled with creeping mist. As with traditional representations of saints, each was surrounded by attributes. One, situated in a graveyard, conjured zombies with a nail-punctured human heart, poison from a blowfish, and the miraculous little blue pills that aid in raising the dead. Another, adopting the posture of someone who constantly works on a car in the street, turned her junker into a flourishing witch s garden. The last stood at her vanity, casting spells and hoping to capture the one she loves with the help of a voodoo doll, perfume, and face powder a combination of Chanel and Hershey s Cocoa. In all three cases, Holland fashioned images of creative, resourceful women whose magic is a metaphor for using everyday materials to make the proverbial silk purse from a sow s ear. Her lush and detailed figurative paintings are simultaneously literal and allegorical; they combine the eerie quality of nineteenth-century ghost stories with the visual language of a hip-hop music video. Black Magic Woman also alluded to a theatrical stage set, calling further attention to the artificial construction of the stereotypes it portrayed."

Made from two canvases stretched on a circular frame, surrounded by foam rubber painted to resemble bark,\u00a0Cookie\u00a0towered at nine feet in diameter, dwarfing the viewer.\u00a0Cookie s\u00a0painstakingly painted growth rings represented both the tree s age and the duration of the artist s process.\u00a0The Wood\u00a0also included\u00a0Young Pines, two clusters of tree silhouettes with articulated branches jigsaw-cut from pine plywood: a manufactured material returning to its original form. Levy built many of her trees using construction techniques borrowed from theater props, tents, toys, and  knock-down  furniture; she delights in the irony inherent in creating portable, artificial props to represent such venerable natural objects."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Working in film, video, and installation, Diana Thater has been an innovator in her medium for 20 years and is best known for creating complex visual and spatial environments. Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.\nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.\nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth. Between Science and Magic is Thater s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in over 10 years.\nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Broad Art Foundation, The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation, and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation.\n \nRelated Links:"

        "DESCRIPTION":"The renowned artist s first career retrospective highlights his paintings from 1964 to 2007. While Hendricks has worked in a variety of media throughout his career, and has explored diverse subject matter, he is best known for his striking and provocative life-sized portraits of everyday African-American people from the urban northeast. Bringing to mind American realism, pop culture, and post-modernism in a way uniquely his own, Hendricks  pioneering contributions to African-American portraiture and conceptualism claims a compelling space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz, and African-American conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. At times cool, at times confrontational, sometimes sexually charged, and always empowering, the work reveals the artist s keen eye for his subject s attire, attitude, style, and point of view. Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.\nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.\nBirth of the Cool\u00a0is organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the\u00a0http:\/\/www.nasher.duke.edu\/exhibitions_hendricks.php Nasher Museum of Art\u00a0in Durham, North Carolina.\nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.\nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. It was also shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem.\nBorn in Philadelphia, the artist studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before receiving his B.F.A and M.F.A. at Yale University, where he studied with legendary photographer Walker Evans. He is currently a Professor of Art Studio at Connecticut College, in New London, Connecticut.\nBirth of the Cool has been named one of\u00a0Vogue Magazine s\u00a0top 25 cultural events of the year.\n \nThe exhibition was organized by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.\nThis exhibition is sponsored in part by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., the National Endowment for the Arts, which believes that a great nation deserves great art, the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, and the North Carolina Arts Council with funding from the State of North Carolina.\nSupport for the presentation at SMMoA is generously provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton.

        "DESCRIPTION":"Art After White People: Time, Trees,   Celluloid \u00a0was the first major West Coast museum exhibition by William Pope.L, the self-dubbed  friendliest black artist in America,  who, throughout his thirty-year career, has challenged social inequity with dark humor and biting critique. For the Santa Monica Museum of Art, Pope.L created an installation in three parts The Grove, APHOV (A Personal History of Videography),and\u00a0The Semen Pictures that confronted and examined ritual, human will, and political ego. Pope.L s interest in ritual layering as an artistic process was evident; all of his  interventions  featured objects or characters transformed by layers and veils made from such materials as paint and blood, or a simple latex mask.\u00a0Art After White People\u00a0brought Pope.L back to his roots in experimental theater with installations resembling stage sets.\nThe Grove\u00a0was a spectral forest of potted palm trees, hand- and spray-painted in many coats of white. Close up, their painted skin appeared spotty, even wart-like a commentary on the social, psychological, and environmental consequences of man s will to bend nature. Pope.L chose the palm trees for this installation as  local scenery,  and in his noir vision of Los Angeles, the city s most prevalent icons of tropical paradise wore a toxic costume that would eventually destroy them.\nPast\u00a0The Grove, viewers saw a free-standing screening wall reminiscent of old-fashioned drive-in theaters or highway billboards. On screen,\u00a0APHOV\u00a0featured as its protagonist a masked man resembling former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, weeping streams of artificial blood. The blood pooled on the floor of the man s  lair,  a makeshift archive piled high with cardboard storage boxes of videotapes organized by date. The rest of the on-screen clutter expanded into the real space of the museum, including furniture and the mysterious, locked industrial doors through which one could only peek at an endless warren of boxes and blood.\nBeyond the dark and disorder of the first two works,\u00a0The Semen Pictures\u00a0were bathed in light. Pope.L s final intervention consisted of digital scans of magazine collages covered with organic substances within light boxes. These  portraits,  altered by the addition of semen, hair, milk, coffee grounds, urine, and blood, balanced readymade pop culture with the natural and handmade, and exemplified Pope.L s artistic drive to create complex layers of image and meaning."

        "DESCRIPTION":"For the past decade, Santa Monica-based artist Jona Frank has used photography and film to explore the American adolescent experience. Lincoln High ROTC, Frank s first solo museum exhibition, featured two three-screen videos\u2014Julia, Drill Team and Bravo Company, Squad Drill Competition\u2014about members of the Junior ROTC program at Lincoln High School in the San Francisco Bay area. In these films, her camera angles and cuts revealed both physical and psychological details about the students, from their commitment and seriousness to their youth and awkwardness. Without agenda or judgment, Frank elucidated her subjects  dualities\u2014culturally diverse Junior ROTC students training to embrace a strict and singular vision, and the adolescent penchant to challenge authority in confluence with efforts to conform to group rules. At once dispassionate and intimate, Frank s videos portrayed the timeless and endearingly awkward vulnerability of young people on the threshold of adulthood, searching for personal meaning in their lives by mimicking postures and responses that seek to efface individuality."

Carter s paintings and drawings of icebergs ranged in size from small to monumental and revealed the haunting beauty, dramatic sculptural quality, and unique character of individual icebergs\u2014from the poetic and atmospheric to the stark and foreboding. Pezalla-Granlund s iceberg sculptures, formed from paper and foam core, were fragile and irregular, lightweight and easily crushed\u2014in purposeful opposition to their real-world counterparts. Suspended from the ceiling, five icebergs of various dimensions floated flat side up with their asymmetrical, jutting edges extending towards the floor. In the intimate space of Project Room 1, the two treatments resonated to immerse the viewer in the awe and mystery of icebergs."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Identity Theft\u00a0was the first show to feature the early, pioneering work of Eleanor Antin, Lynn Hershman, and Suzy Lake, artists who developed alter egos or false identities in photographs, videos, on stage, and in real-life performances. Conceived and guest-curated by Jori Finkel, the exhibition explored the history of role-playing in contemporary art through works created during the heyday of feminism.\u00a0Identity Theft\u00a0marked a number of milestones in the exposition of these artists  works: the first-ever full presentation of Hershman s\u00a0Roberta Breitmore\u00a0project; the first screening of Antin s\u00a0The Nurse and the Hijackers\u00a0since September 11, 2001, when the disaster movie spoof (set on an airplane) was pulled from an exhibition in England; and the first U.S. showing of Lake s groundbreaking\u00a0Transformations\u00a0series since their 1975 debut. The exhibition included more than 100 photographs, videos, sculpture, and ephemera.\nIn San Francisco in 1974, Lynn Hershman donned a wig and adopted a particular set of gestures to create an alter ego named Roberta Breitmore, a fictional character who grew so real over the years that she acquired her own driver s license, apartment, and romantic encounters. She also went to Weight Watchers, EST seminars, and psychotherapy. Hershman alternately describes Roberta as the  underbelly  of her own personality and a  mirror held up to her culture. \nIn Southern California starting in 1972, Eleanor Antin gave birth to three  selves : a king, a ballerina, and a nurse, which she compared to Jungian archetypes. First, she painstakingly applied a beard and took to the streets of Solana Beach as a king attending his peoples. She next became her  idealized female self  a classical ballerina, practicing her technique every day so she could quasi-legitimately play the role in staged and taped performance. Later, in photographs and videos, she brought to life two different kinds of nurses: a flirtatious nurse worthy of any soap opera and a historical figure inspired by Florence Nightingale.\nMeanwhile, in Montreal, Detroit-born artist Suzy Lake investigated the cultural construction of character by trying on various roles for size. She posed as a glamorous fashion model for one series, which took the form of a slideshow (1972-75). She borrowed the facial features of her friends for another, which consists of large-scale pre-Photoshop manipulated photographs called\u00a0Transformations\u00a0(1974). She also applied cosmetics directly to the surface of photographic prints, recognizing makeup as the oil paint of the day, and her face as the canvas.\nTogether, Antin, Hershman, and Lake were pioneers of what art critic Kim Levin once called the  high-risk  art of self-transformation. Their work challenged fixed notions of identity and femininity, raising questions of who we are and whom we can pass as. They combined acting skills with more traditional artmaking techniques to document their double lives in detail. They relied above all on the medium of photography, paving the way for conceptual artists to come, from Cindy Sherman to Nikki S. Lee."

Dutcher s paintings were similarly compartmentalized, each cubicle richly decorated with objects suggesting the passage of time and inspiring individual and communal narratives mandala-like braided rag rugs, pinwheel collaged elements, and stacked hour glass forms all suggested animated portals leading to another world. These scenes were inhabited by crudely rendered figures painted in a thick and colorful impasto. At once celebratory and somber, Dutcher s imagery blurred the line between quotidian still life and spiritual dreamscape.\u00a0\nGone\u00a0included a new, site-specific work,\u00a0The Martyrdom of the Philosopher, created especially for the Santa Monica Museum of Art."

        "DESCRIPTION":"Enigma Variations: Philip Guston and Giorgio de Chirico\u00a0explored the influence of de Chirico s distinctive vision on Guston, and investigated the two artists  shared motifs, subjects, and affinities. Although the Greek-born, Italian de Chirico (1888-1978) and the American Philip Guston (1913-1980) were from different generations and painted in different artistic environments, Guston closely followed de Chirico s work throughout his life. Featuring works from the early and late careers of both artists,\u00a0Enigma Variations examined Guston s transformation of de Chirico s visual vocabulary antique statues, mannequins, gladiators, clocks, and canvas stretchers through his own unique and inimitable style.\nGuston s interest in de Chirico s imagery went hand in hand with a heartfelt admiration for the example the older artist set as an artist. De Chirico had weathered a barrage of criticism after his early success with his Metaphysical paintings from the 1910s, but he nonetheless embraced radical change and painted in a variety of styles while serially revisiting his own earlier motifs for the next fifty years. Guston too made a major stylistic shift: away from the formal purity of abstract expressionism from the 1940s and 1950s, which had won him great acclaim to raw, controversial figurative paintings at the end of the 1960s, which were initially harshly reviewed.\u00a0Enigma Variations\u00a0featured rarely seen late works by de Chirico, about which Guston remained an outspoken champion, always inspired and delighted by de Chirico s capacity to surprise.\u00a0Enigma Variations\u00a0investigated the specific parallels and points of intersection in ideas of these two twentieth-century masters, offering a unique lens through which to see and understand the work. The exhibition was cocurated by Michael Taylor of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Lisa Melandri of the Santa Monica Museum of Art.\n \n 1 (left) Philip Guston\nBy the Window, 1969\nOil on canvas\n78 x 81 1\/4 inches\nPrivate collection, courtesy of McKee Gallery, New York copyright the Estate of Philip Guston\n(right) Giorgio de Chirico\nThe Poet and His Muse, 1925\nOil and tempera on canvas\n35 7\/8 x 29 inches\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, The Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection\ncopyright Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\/SIAE, Rome"

Brecher, a social anthropologist by training and former museum director, has amassed an empire of objects that represent an idealized view of material culture a nonhierarchical world in which everything is considered and appreciated for its meaning and not its market value. Reflecting Brecher s life as an inveterate traveler, the trail of artifacts took us from his parents  bedside in Highland Park, Illinois, to the Mato Grosso in Brazil and the sand dunes of the Sahara. Epiphanies also included a video by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris."

Voyager highlighted portions of her oeuvre from 1999 to 2005, and was Bettineschi s first West Coast museum exhibition. Though abstracted, Voyager nonetheless told a science-fiction story of a young woman s journey through space and time on a quest for omniscience. For SMMoA, Bettineschi created an installation comprising two bodies of work that formed a visual mosaic. The first, a series of light boxes titled At the Speed of Light (2005), transmitted rich colored and gestural light drawings and motion-altered photographs suggesting extraterrestrial travel. The second, Spaceship (1999), consisted of images printed directly on Plexiglas in reflective silver and black, portraying real and imaginary flying machines. Both series used the transparency and luminosity of the glass to combine the poetic and the ethereal with the mechanized and the concrete. At once slick and haunting, Bettineschi s work transported the viewer to an alternate universe."

Conceived and organized by guest curator Joshua Decter, and designed by the architectural collective servo, the exhibition featured the work of 75 distinguished artists and architects from around the world.\nDark Places brought an alternative, experimental approach to the organization and installation of a group exhibition. It was conceived to reanimate relationships among art, architecture, media, and technological design, and to generate a new kind of immersive environment the hallucination of a futuristic noir scenario inside the frame of the museum.\nThe exhibition asked: What, and where, are the enigmatic places in our urban and suburban worlds? How do we navigate through ambiguous social spaces? How do we experience the historical traces of complex and disturbing events within our homes, neighborhoods, and cities? What are the atmospheric, psychological, and political conditions that define our constructed environments? How are we affected by fear, violence, and paranoia, expressed through such technologies as surveillance and the Internet, as well as by the popular media? And, how might we reappropriate these actual and fictional narratives to achieve social, political, and spiritual transformation to illuminate the dark places?\nParticipants who responded to these questions by making new work, or selecting or modifying existing work to be recontextualized within the exhibition in digital form included: Acconci Studio, Franz Ackermann, Francis Al\u00ffs, Michael Ashkin, Jaime \u00c1vila Ferrer, Dennis Balk, Matthew Barney, Judith Barry, Thomas Bayrle, Julie Becker, Douglas Blau, Monica Bonvicini, Daniel Bozhkov, Mark Bradford, Troy Brauntuch, Fran\u00e7ois Bucher, Sophie Calle, Eduardo Consuegra, Jordan Crandall, Teddy Cruz, Jonas Dahlberg, Stephen Dean, Anne Deleporte, Diller + Scofidio, Sam Durant, Anna Gaskell, Douglas Gordon, gruppo A12, Fariba Hajamadi, Pablo Helguera, Noritoshi Hirakawa, Julian Hoeber, Emily Jacir, Christian Jankowski, Vincent Johnson, Mitchell Kane, Joachim Koester, Glenn Ligon, Dorit Margreiter, Fiorenza Menini, John Miller, Muntadas, Paul Myoda, Yoshua Okon, Catherine Opie, Lucy Orta, Hirsch Perlman, Raymond Pettibon, Richard Phillips, Richard Prince, Raqs Media Collective, Miguel Rio Branco, Alexis Rockman, Julian Rosefeldt, Aura Rosenberg, Peter Rostovsky, Sam Samore, Paige Sarlin, Julia Scher, Gregor Schneider, Allan Sekula, Andres Serrano, Nedko Solakov, Doron Solomons, Wolfgang Staehle, Javier Tellez, Anton Vidokle, Eyal Weizman\/Nadav Harel, James Welling, Wim Wenders, Judi Werthein, Charlie White, M\u00e5ns Wrange, Jody Zellen, and Heimo Zobernig.\nDecter organized the varied submissions painting, photography, drawing, video, film, animation, architecture, and film clips into eight curatorial sequences that generated unique, visual correspondences and thematic linkages. Upon entering the museum space, the viewer encountered a hovering, translucent armature with elongated vacuum-formed plastic strands that delivered the succession of scripted digitized works through four front projectors, four rear projectors, and a network of glowing fiber optics a delivery mechanism that echoed and embodied the themes of the work presented."

Livermore began the series in plein air fashion during three weekend drives along Texas Farm Road 170, on which she hauled along eighteen pieces of plywood. She laid the boards down on the ground before craggy scenes and quickly drew her impressions with a light mixture of oil paint and gasoline. During the next two years she worked on the pictures in her studio in El Paso. Unlike traditional plein air painting, Livermore s landscapes are filled with a brooding implied narrative fractured, jutting, cavernous, and glowing, they suggest a maelstrom brewing above and beneath the surface.\nBorn and raised in the Upper Midwest, Livermore was a librarian before she retired to El Paso to paint. She has completed many radiant and lyrical bodies of work inspired by the cities and scenery of the region, including Jornada del Muerto,  N  Bar, and Desert Dream City. Her work was included in a 1999 exhibition at the Yale University Art Gallery titled Postmodern Transgressions: Art Beyond the Frame, and has been exhibited at the Cline Fine Art, Santa Fe, New Mexico; the Adair Margo Gallery, El Paso, Texas; and the Art Museum of South Texas, Corpus Christi, Texas."

By relentlessly repeating this language, Bismuth presented a paradox to the viewer, with the words creating an expectation that remains unfulfilled.\nPierre Bismuth utilizes diverse media such as drawing, collage, musical composition, and video, to track, document, and reveal the complex thought processes that underlie human memory, comprehension, and interpretation. His work also explores the effects of language and the proliferation of images on every day life. Bismuth has had numerous solo and group exhibitions in such venues as Art Basel; the Venice Biennale; the Art Gallery of York University, Toronto, Canada; Sprengel Museum Hannover; the Kunstmuseum, Thun, Switzerland; and the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels. Born in Paris, Bismuth lives and works in Brussels and London. He is best known to American audiences for his work on the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which he, Michel Gondry, and Charlie Kaufman received an Academy Award in 2005 for best original screenplay."

Berman s hand-printed, personally distributed literary journal, Semina (1955-1964) stands as an iconic document of its time. The first major museum exhibition to examine the significance of the charismatic Wallace Berman, Semina Culture: Wallace Berman   His Circle featured the complete loose-leaf run of Semina, as well as artworks, photographs, and publications by forty-nine artists that manifest the scope and interests of the new  Semina Culture.  More than seventy photographic portraits from Berman s archive were also shown for the first time, revealing the close-knit nature of this underground community.\nThese participants in an important emerging counterculture, the Beat movement of the 1950s and 1960s, pursued an alternative way of thinking about the purpose and formal nature of art, infusing their works with nostalgia, lyricism, feeling, and a sense of the ephemeral. They include Robert Alexander, John Altoon, Toni Basil, Paul Beattie, Ray and Bonnie Bremser, Charles Brittin, Joan Brown, Cameron, Bruce Conner, Jean Conner, Jay DeFeo, Diane DiPrima, Kirby Doyle, Bobby Driscoll, Robert Duncan, Joe Dunn, Llyn Foulkes, Loree Foxx, Ralph Gibson, Allen Ginsberg, Billy Gray, George Herms, Jack Hirschman, Dennis Hopper, Billy Jahrmarkt, Jess, Lawrence Jordan, Patricia Jordan, Bob Kaufman, Philip Lamantia, William Margolis, Michael McClure, Taylor Mead, David Meltzer, Henry Miller, Stuart Perkoff, John Reed, Arthur Richer, Rachel Rosenthal, Jack Smith, Dean Stockwell, Ben Talbert, Russel Tamblyn, Aya (Tarlow), Edmund Teske, Zack Walsh, Lew Welch, and John Wieners. For these iconoclasts, art was a joyful and creative expression, not a means to an artworld career. Their approach to the purpose and formal nature of art and culture existed on a vastly different track from the canonical traditions of abstract expressionism, minimalism, and postmodernism.\nGuest-curated by Michael Duncan and Kristine McKenna, Semina Culture traveled to the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, Utah State University, Logan, Utah (January 10   March 15, 2006); the Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas (April 21   July 9, 2006); the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum   Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, California (October 17   December 10, 2006); and The Grey Art Gallery, New York University, New York, New York (January 16   March 31, 2007)."

A musician, poet, and visual and spoken-word artist for more than thirty years, Cervenka created journals, dating from 1974 through 2005, that combine rough drafts of songs and personal reflections rendered in a baroque calligraphic script, with photographs, drawings, and scraps of ephemera that she found while traveling as a musician. Similarly, she created the collages from found materials to form an interpretative composite portrait of the country she came to know through her life experiences on the road. America the Beautiful was guest-curated by Michael Duncan and Kristine McKenna."

This major historical exhibition illuminated the extraordinary contributions made to abstract art by Hilma af Klint (Sweden, 1862-1944), Emma Kunz (Switzerland, 1892-1963), and Agnes Martin (Canada, 1912-2004). Each used distinctive formal devices particularly line, grid, and geometry to visualize and transform complex philosophical, scientific, and metaphysical ideas into powerful and transcendent works of art.\nThe exhibition focused on a specific period of production within the life of each artist   af Klint s spare and evocative compositions made between 1895 and 1920; Kunz s complex large-scale drawings based on mathematical geometries; and Martin s meditative early grids, primarily from the 1960s when the grid was first emerging as a focus of her work. 3 x Abstraction introduced a wider public to the seminal, inspirational work af Klint and Kunz, and presented intriguing new perspectives on the oeuvre of Agnes Martin. 3 x Abstraction was organized by cocurators Catherine de Zegher, director of The Drawing Center, New York, and writer and independent curator Hendel Teicher."

These intimate, ethereal, and personal vessel forms, at once intriguing and playful, reveal how the shapes between the wires are just as important as the wires themselves. Inspired by the random scribbles of her year-old grandchild and the intricate weaving of a spider s web, Bonovitz created a body of work that both embodies and defies the vessel form. She explored a range of aesthetic interests the process of drawing, the physicality of sculpted objects, and the translucency of materials that have engaged her over the past twenty-five years of working in porcelain and clay."

Hopps, who first met Herms in 1956, one year before he opened the legendary Ferus Gallery, placed Herms on a dazzling continuum of assemblage artists that includes Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp, and Joseph Cornell, as well as California luminaries Wallace Berman and Edward Keinholz. Included early on in the ground-breaking exhibition The Art of Assemblage at The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1961, Herms continued to work across disciplines, using poetry, film, theatre, and assemblage as his mediums, as well as starting the LOVE Press in the early 1960s. Herms was a member of the West Coast Beat movement, and credits Wallace Berman with teaching him that any object, even a mundane cast-off, could be of great interest if contextualized properly. This ability to reclaim, recycle, and recreate found objects remains central to Herms s work, from his first secret show in a deserted area in Hermosa Beach to the present. Hot Set featured a range of his celebratory and elegiac work, enlivened by Hopps s lyrical and idiosyncratic installation."

        "DESCRIPTION":"In Morandi s Lawn, Blue McRight illustrated her ecological and environmental concerns in an installation comprising 682 objects and 13 digital photographs. Each day for a year from April 1, 2003 to April 1, 2004 McRight collected and arranged into a still life the recyclable glass, plastic, and metal containers that she and her husband generated in their household. She digitally photographed each still life and then dismantled it. Next, she painstakingly covered the containers with artificial turf and added them to an ever-expanding floor installation, which literally grew into a huge still life that imitated both topiary and natural lawn in color, texture, and scale. Although Morandi s Lawn documented McRight s own personal daily ritual, it addressed larger contemporary issues of consumerism and consumption, trash production, and recycling. The title of the piece alludes to the Italian artist Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964), who painted such simple household containers as vases, wine bottles, cups, and bowls, in an exquisite celebration of the everyday object. The installation therefore venerated and poked fun at the art-historical genre of still life, while also referencing landscape and garden design."

He translates found film, video, and photographic footage into simplified drawings and animations that reduce complex imagery to its most essential, two-dimensional elements. For his slide installation On Photography, created specifically for the Santa Monica Museum of Art, Ezawa selected twenty images representing various examples from the history of photography from the 1860s to the present, and from the iconic to the unrecognizable, ranging in source from journalism, to performance documentation, to art photography. His choices were then manually traced, turned back into 35mm slide format, and projected on a continuous loop. Mimicking the feel of a university slide lecture, On Photography functioned as a visual critical essay, using digital drawings instead of words to explore and reveal the history of the medium."

The nearly fifty works in different media by nineteen contemporary American artists of diverse backgrounds interpreted political and philosophical connections among people of color, and explored their resonance in pop culture and urban life. When Carl Douglas s song  Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting  was a hit, and Bruce Lee was making his last film, Game of Death (costarring Kareem Abdul Jabar), young people break dancing and rhyming in the Bronx were creating the foundation for hip-hop culture. At the same time, the Asian immigration boom was changing the urban landscape of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Black Belt reflected this unique cross-cultural fascination with Bruce Lee, Kung Fu, and Eastern martial arts imagery in a wide range of works in different media. Black Belt was organized by Christine Y. Kim, the Studio Museum in Harlem."

Combining a range of media sculpture, photography, photographic composite prints, film projection, film installation, drawing, and interactive DVD-ROM\u00a0 the exhibition brought to light Pat O Neill s major works from the early 1960s to the present. Although O Neill s films enjoy a devoted following in the avant-garde film community, the SMMoA exhibition located these works in a visual arts context where they can be most fully appreciated as powerful projections of temporal painting, aural composition, and visual poetry. For the majority of visitors, the exhibition was an edifying introduction to the work of an artist whose unique vision engages all the major aesthetic progressions of the post-War era, and whose techniques anticipated technological innovations. In the accompanying catalog, artist Erika Suderburg sums up:  He deploys co-existing strata of obsolescence, repose, revolution, consumption, and anarchic agitation. Ultimately he engages us in seeing.  Julie Lazar, director of International Contemporary Arts Network, served as guest curator."

At first glance, Slade s site selection appears devoid of content, yet upon closer inspection these locations are full of meaning, charting the ebb and flow of financial fortunes, shifts in population, and dynamic and ephemeral histories of neighborhoods. His subjects are entropic places reflecting the natural world, built environment, and human dramas in their chaotic slides towards disorder."

For the site-specific installation This Garden making salt and evaporation drawings, Pocock placed 180 gallons of seawater from the Santa Monica Bay in a specially cast, shallow concrete pond, then employed solar-powered lights and fans to evaporate the seawater and leave behind a salt crystal residue. Throughout the exhibition, the salt was regularly harvested and the pond refilled; salt was available for visitors to taste. Pocock used a large-scale pencil drawing to chart and display atmospheric changes in the museum and the levels of natural evaporation of the seawater, and a projection of photographs documented the water collection process."

In Tick Tock, Donovan looked to sources from Cervantes to Kafka to physically reinvent language\u00a0 piling, stuffing reflecting, and sewing words in a surprising variety of ways."

Purcell s photographs and installations celebrate the beauty and recast the meaning of even the most mundane objects, creating lush visual tableaux and intricate microcosms out of everything from old books and scrap metal to teeth and stones. Two Rooms offered large-scale recreations of two collections, one historical, that of seventeenth-century natural philosopher Olaus Worm (1588-1654), the other contemporary, that of Purcell s found objects. Though both were compiled by avid collectors, each was amassed for different reasons Worm s to explain, define, and categorize the world; Purcell s to question those very classifications. This was the first major installation of her work in the United States."

In such key works as Cycle Ending, Per I-V (1960) and Parthenon (1962), Jensen developed the parameters of a vision that would define his work over the next twenty years: signs from Mayan calendrical and numerical systems, palette from Goethian color theory, and patterns echoing Guatemala s landscape, architecture, and textiles.

        "DESCRIPTION":"Unlike her contemporaries, the Viennese Actionists, the seminal Austrian artist VALIE EXPORT created distinctly feminist works intended to provoke social change and to overturn prevailing attitudes towards women. Her early performance art demanded the involvement of the audience on a visceral level. She used her body as a medium as a challenge to erotic hypocrisy, as a way of perceiving and codifying information, and as a means to counter the horrifying political realities of the past. This exhibition presented a thirty-year survey of photographs and videos documenting VALIE EXPORT s early performance works, digital and conceptual photography, expanded cinema, large-scale video installations, and films. Ob\/De+Con(Struction) was organized by Elsa Longhauser for the Goldie Paley Gallery at Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia."

He also set up a studio inside the Museum to let people view the performance of his painting. Keene chose images of works from catalogs of Los Angeles art collections and then duplicated them simultaneously on thirty or forty plywood boards he had set up around the gallery. The paintings were hung throughout the museum salon-style, then sold for prices ranging from $3 to $25. Keene compares his paintings to souvenirs, trading cards, and music CDs:  It s art, it s cheap, and it changes your life, but the object has no status.  This was Keene s largest show to date and his first exhibition on the West Coast."

Weaned on American consumerism and daily Japanese cartoons, these artists create works that demonstrate an ambivalent relationship with mass culture. Nara s work combines the idea of mass consumerism of popular culture with the simple forms and colors of traditional Japanese art caricatures. With children and animals as perpetual motifs, his cartoon and manga comics-inspired art takes the form of sculpture, drawings, and painting, as well as T-shirts, watches, posters, and books. His children with their large heads, vacant eyes, and adult expressions express a unique and complex psychology in which cuteness, melancholy, and cruelty are linked. The scale and presence of these teasingly psychological works suggest a darker side of childhood memories even as they are pleasantly reminiscent of a preverbal infancy. This was Nara s first exhibition in an American museum."

Conceived as an installation, Mementos featured three new paintings, two sculptural components, and a video projection. Presenting an angelic pantheon of African-American cultural and political figures who died between 1959 and 1970, Marshall used the genre of history painting to reread the legacy of the Civil Rights movement and the whole of African-American history in relation to a very complex present. Complementing the exhibition, a day-long symposium at UCLA, cosponsored by the Center for African American Studies and Cultural Studies in the African Diaspora Project, addressed themes of memory and social and cultural history in art. Mementos was organized by the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago."

Playing with Matches was organized by Wayne Baerwaldt of Plug In Inc., a nonprofit center for contemporary art in Winnipeg, Canada; the accompanying illustrated catalog was copublished by Smart Art Press and Plug In Editions."

Remarkably, everything in the setting from the one million blades of grass to the barbecue grill and the picnic table laden with food was constructed from tiny beads. In conjunction with this momentous unveiling of Lou s new work, the Museum also presented Kitchen, a 1995 installation from the collection of Eileen and Peter Norton. This exhibition was the most comprehensive presentation of this Los Angeles artist s work to date. Smart Art Press published an accompanying catalog."

Both countries have developed economically in the shadow of their more powerful neighbors (the U.S. and England); both are characterized by widespread migration; both share a strong tradition of Catholicism as well as deep roots in their ancient mythologies. Distant Relations revealed a rich, artistic dialogue about exile, invisibility, the loss of language and culture, a confrontation with the past, and the emergence of new hybrid cultures. This multimedia exhibition included the work of twelve internationally recognized artists: Willie Doherty, David Fox, Javier de la Garza, Silvia Gruner, Frances Hegarty, John Kindness, Alice Maher, Daniel J. Martinez, Amalia Mesa-Bains, Philip Napier, Rub\u00e9n Ortiz Torres, and John Valadez. Curated by independent curator Trisha Ziff, Distant Relations was organized by the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, England, and the Santa Monica Museum of Art.

Consisting of a sequence of 105 large-scale, color photographs interspersed with narrative panels authored by Sekula, as well as two slide projections, Fish Story wove an intricate web of visual and verbal associations among panoramic views of the sea, detailed close-ups of nautical devices, cargo containers, warehouses, sailors, and shipyard workers, locating the individual elements in an ever-shifting cross-current of global exchange: of goods, money, knowledge, and power.

Composed of an artist s book, drawings, collages, and sculpture made from urban detritus (candy wrappers, bits of plastic, wire, and rags), Behind the Mask considered issues of individual, national, and universal identity in relation to the moral struggles of our time struggles that are characterized less by the conflict of good and evil than by ambiguity and guilt."

Organized by Sue Spaid, a freelance curator, Action Station included work by Terri Friedman, Joseph Grigely, Laura Howe, Lunna Menoh, and Carol Szymanski, as well as historically related Fluxus works by artists such as George Brecht and Yoko Ono."
