        "description":"I chose a shiny moir\u00e9 fabric in a mauve color. The shine of the material relates to the glazed sugar on the dessert, and the patterned weave adds an element of sharpness and contrast to the softly cushioned fabric. The sugary treat seems to have \"weight\" because it sits in a gently indented space that looks somewhat flesh-like.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called \"Forbidden Pleasures\"--occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements. Callis has said that these soft, sweet, colorful pastries, each lit and staged on a fabric of complimentary texture and design, is about the \"idea that desserts and eating desserts carries some of the same psychological baggage as guilt.\" In other words, eating rich desserts in this health-conscious time can be considered a crime of sorts. In these images, there is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to human sexuality. The seductive ingredients of the pastries and their fabric environments simulate the look of flesh. Although the motivation for this project may have been an impulsive urge to have fun with both the glossy Cibachrome medium and the subject of sweets, Callis was no doubt drawing on the tradition of abundance found in earlier still life painting and the extravagant color of more recent painters representing popular culture.",

        "description":"In the time that it took the photographer to make this image, the soft yellow light of mid-day had shifted (on the left) to the golden hues of late afternoon, (on the right).This is one of forty-seven images that make up the series Habitat 7. Using an 8 x 10-inch camera mounted on a tripod, Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao made numerous exposures over the course of several hours, adjusting it to expand his angle of vision or capture the changing light. After scanning his color negatives, Liao used digital editing software to stitch together a large-scale image that presents broad sweeps of information in minute detail. The resulting inkjet print is a complex, composite image that encapsulates the elements of time and movement.Since moving to New York in 1999, Liao has lived along the number 7 subway line, which connects Main Street in Flushing, Queens, to Times Square in Manhattan. Likening the train's path to the rivers around which ancient civilizations developed and flourished, Liao selected specific locations as both the subject and vantage point for his Habitat 7 series. The series \"transports\" viewers from Flushing to the east and moving westward through the neighborhoods of Corona Park, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Sunnyside before arriving in Manhattan. Each image creates a seamless whole, as does Liao's portrayal of the culturally and economically diverse communities that coexist harmoniously along the eight and a half miles of the train, sometimes referred to as the \"International Express.\"",

The side drawers in thefriezecannot be opened unless the center drawer has been pulled out slightly. A metal rod at the back of the drawer is then released, allowing the sides to be opened smoothly.

The octagonal bell tower of Ivan the Great rises just above and to the right. Another sixteenth-century building, the Cathedral of the Archangel, neighbors the bell tower.In September 1852, Fenton-who had only taken up photography a few months earlier-traveled to Russia with an acquaintance who was constructing a bridge for Czar Nicholas I. Perhaps recognizing that he was one of the first photographers to train his camera on Russia, Fenton made views of Moscow and St. Petersburg, capturing the distinct architectural character of each city.

First, proud grandparents hold the infant on the day of his baptism in 1974. Then, at eleven years old, the boy is shown in a suit and tie beside his grandmother. The boy's grandfather is not included in this image, which immediately provokes questions as to his whereabouts. The likely cause of his absence can only be his death. Finally, the boy is shown as a strong young man of eighteen, towering over his small grandmother who leans on a dresser for support.Rogovin has spent two decades photographing families in his neighborhood of Buffalo, New York. As a member of the community, he is trusted to represent faithfully and sensitively the lives of his subjects. His portraits are consistently presented as sets of three pictures showing the changes that families undergo over time.",

The unusual feature of this vase is the odd way the men are dressed. They wear longchitonsand turban-like headdresses, and attendants shelter them with parasols. Several dozen vases with similarly dressed revelers survive. Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C. Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C. A quieter scene decorates the interior of the cup, with a young man offering a flower to a standing woman holding a mirror.",

To do this, he used a combination of black, white, and red chalk on blue paper--the paper favored by most Venetian artists during the 1500s and 1600s. As Saint Paul gazes down, the light touches his broad forehead, nose, and ear, showing his furrowed brow, gaunt cheeks, and thinning hair with forceful naturalism. His beard and mustache seem to absorb the light, obscuring his deeply shadowed mouth, neck, and shoulders. Set against a darkened background, the saint's head seems to rise out of the gloom. Although early church documents describe Paul as being short, bald, and ungainly, Savoldo gave him a sense of quiet dignity appropriate to one of the founders of the Christian Church",

The brilliance of Michetti's color, particularly the halo of white around his face, also evokes thescherzo's liveliness. During the later 1800s, many artists believed in a concept known assynesthesia: that color and sound were so closely related that color could stimulate the sensation of sound and sound could stimulate the sensation of color.At age twenty-six, in the same year that one of his pictures received great public acclaim, Michetti drew multiple self-portraits.

Here Munch tried to capture the emotions called forth by the night rather than to record its picturesque qualities. The color blue conveys the mysticism and melancholy of the landscape, which seems full of premonitions. An abstract mound at the right represents a clump of trees; a white fence runs diagonally in front. The vaguely defined shape on the fence may be a shadow of two lovers, a recurring theme in Munch's work. He used an undulating line to depict the shoreline that continues into the trees at the right. Stars reflect in the water, and a flash of light in the trees shines brightly.Varying thicknesses of blue and green paint are blended together to form the impression of a night sky. Some areas are thickly painted, while others are left bare to convey the lighter segments of the sky or a celestial phenomenon.",

        "description":"According to medieval legend, Saint Margaret was an early Christian convert who was tortured and put in jail when she refused to renounce her Christian beliefs. While in jail, she prayed to God to show her the enemy who was fighting her, and a great dragon appeared and swallowed her whole. While inside the beast, Margaret made the sign of the cross, at which point the dragon's belly burst open and she emerged unscathed. This image of Margaret rising unharmed from the belly of a dragon accompanies the suffrage of Saint Margaret. A golden cross appears above Margaret's clasped hands, a symbol of her faith and a physical representation of the sign she made while inside the dragon.Saint Margaret was a popular saint in the Middle Ages, often invoked by women in childbirth. According to her legend, just before her death by beheading, she prayed that any woman faced with a difficult labor who invoked her aid would give birth to a healthy child, just as she herself was safely delivered from the belly of the dragon.",

        "description":"In a simply framed miniature in this book of hours, Saint Bellinus, a little-known local saint, celebrates Mass before the kneeling Gualenghi-d'Este family. The saint, a twelfth-century bishop of Padua, clasps the outstretched arms of Andrea Gualengo while also gesturing toward heaven. Saints were believed to act as intermediaries between God and the faithful. Here Bellinus, long dead, appears before those who pray to him, bridging the gap between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries and between this world and the next.The patrons of this manuscript appear with two sons, probably from one of Orsina's previous marriages. Orsina was a member of the ruling Este family in Ferrara, and Andrea Gualengo came from a family of high-ranking advisors at the Este court and held important ambassadorial posts. Andrea and Orsina are attired in the richly decorated robes, tunics, capes, and gowns characteristic of Italian Renaissance courts. The intimate service takes place within the simple interior of a chapel, enriched only by the veined marble panels in the background and the coffered ceiling, standard details of the new Renaissance architectural style popular at the time.",

Later, G\u00e9r\u00f4me's pupil Charles Bargue included a lithograph after it in their influential teaching manual, Drawing Course (1866 - 1871).  The drawing depicted one of only two non-European subjects in the book.

Despite the apparent realism of his drawings, however, they are seldom objective records.

Thin strokes exaggerate his birdlike features, which include a nose that resembles a beak, spindly legs, and duck-toed feet. Fluid washes and pen lines are applied sparingly to his costume and puffy wig. The man seems oblivious to his ridiculous looks, an exaggeration that is typical of caricature--a comical style of portraiture.Leonardo da Vinci first sketched caricatures in the 1500s, and Italian artists centuries afterward furthered the genre. Working two hundred years after Da Vinci, Tiepolo drew caricatures like this funny-looking man in addition to the serious subjects for which he is known. He made these drawings as independent works of art, sometimes for his own amusement. His drawings cast anonymous people as stereotypes, such as lawyers, dandies, doctors, and hunchbacks.",

I noticed that, for the average French citizen, even the sight of this national institution was awe-inspiring. I simply became very curious and wanted to know what was behind that imposing facade. As I wandered farther and higher up in the building, I ended up in the huge attic...the clock was under the cupola. Its glass face with Roman numerals gave me this fantastic view onto the Pont des Arts with the Louvre behind it.--Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9szLooking at this photograph simulates a feeling of standing beside the photographer, looking out on a wintry Parisian cityscape. Through Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz's careful juxtaposition, the clock's silhouetted Roman numerals and hands appear to align with various elements of the scene below. The V points to the statue's shadow, the IIII traps two pedestrians, the III rests atop magazine stands flanking the Seine, and the star shape on the clock's hand blocks the far end of a bridge crossing the river. Darker than anything else, the clock's numerals and hand appear to be cut out and collaged onto the print's surface, rather than a natural part of the scene.This photograph demonstrates Kert\u00e9sz's strategic use of flat, foreground elements against a deep background to suggest a sense of space. But he became most well known for his bird's-eye perspective, which reflects his desire to photograph behind the scenes from unconventional viewpoints.",

The elegant illuminations of the missal, consisting of decorated calendar pages, numerous historiated initials, ornamented borders, and miniatures, place the book within the tradition of Bolognese manuscript illumination. The manuscript's anonymous illuminator, known as the Master of the Brussels Initials, was trained in Bologna, a city whose book trade flourished due to the prestige and growth of the university.

Though this image depicts children, the monument was more frequently a rendezvous point for unemployed actors in the 1850s and 1860s. In the 1870s the area became the heart of the commercial entertainment district and then was graced with a newly landscaped green park. Monument House in thebackground, a home newly converted into a hotel, demonstrates that the neighboring private houses in this formerly fashionable district were also giving way to commercial establishments.",

        "description":"I remember coming across Paul Strand'sBlind Womanwhen I was very young, and that really bowled me over. . . . It's a very powerful picture. I saw it in the New York Public Library file ofCamera Work, and I remember going out of there over stimulated: That's the stuff, that's the thing to do. It charged me up.--Walker EvansThe impact of seeing this striking image for the first time is evident in Walker Evans's vivid recollection. At the time, most photographers were choosing \"pretty\" subjects and creating fanciful atmospheric effects in the style of theImpressionists. Paul Strand's unconventional subject and direct approach challenged assumptions about the medium.At once depicting misery and endurance, struggle and degradation, Strand's portrait of a blind woman sets up a complex confrontation. \"The whole concept of blindness,\" as one historian has noted, \"is aimed like a weapon at those whose privilege of sight permits them to experience the picture. . . .\"",

They don't care what is around the object as long as nothing interferes with the object itself, right in the center . . . . what they really want to see is a picture with a figure or an object in the middle of it. They want something obvious. The blindness is apparent when someone lets slip the word \"snapshot.\" Ignorance can always be covered by \"snapshot.\" The word has never had any meaning. I am at war with the obvious.\"Thus William Eggleston described his philosophy of picture-making. Indeed, the furniture in this home seems to have been assembled expressly to achieve the kind of central focus that Eggleston decried. Yet he chose to carefully place the organ just to the right of the picture's center and to shoot from an unusually low vantage point, so that the furniture seems to loom, holding court in the space.",

The Adoration of the Magi appears on both sides of the arched, recessed window at the top. The three kings gather to admire the Christ Child standing in his mother's lap on the right. In the center of the lower register is the Crucifixion scene, surrounded by scenes from the Passion of Christ, the theme of the chapel. The coats of arms of various popes fill the window frame at the top.In 1520 this chapel was assigned to the Vatican's Swiss Guards, and shortly afterwards Perino was commissioned to decorate it. Scholars believe that this drawing was made around 1522 because it contains the coat of arms of Pope Adrian VI, who only led the Church for a year, from 1522 and 1523. Perino began work on the frescoes in 1522 but he never completed them because of a serious plague outbreak in 1523. The frescoes were later finished by Polidoro da Caravaggio.",

In this view of the Palatine Hill's northeast corner, a site also sketched by his friend Hubert Robert and by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Fragonard created a powerful visual momentum by coordinating the forward thrust of the corner of the palace, the brilliant sunlight, and the towering cypresses. The dynamic, plunging perspective of walls and trees and the intense light infuse the massive architecture with life.Fragonard masterfully used both chalk and paper to create the overall effect and the varied small passages. Overall, he worked the red chalk lightly yet broadly, allowing the white of the paper to come through even in areas of deepest shading. His controlled exposure of the paper's whiteness, the constant shift of direction and character in his shading strokes, and his inventive calligraphy describe sunlight, shadow, and texture in diverse ways.",

        "description":"This grim scene of injured American soldiers reveals the horrors they faced in the brutal Vietnam War. The troops had gathered on a mud-covered hillside, which they had used as a makeshift First Aid center while attempting to take areas known as Hills 400 and 484. While this image focuses on the bandaged, bloodied African-American soldier in the center, diagonally positioned limbs of men on the left side of the image direct attention to a mud-covered soldier lying injured on the ground.Photojournalist Larry Burrows framed this image in a manner that emphasizes an apocalyptic, scorched earth in the colors of brown and muted cyan. But there is a hint of vividness in the bright white, bloodstained bandage of a soldier centered in the picture. Prior to Vietnam, war images were typically made using black and white film, so Burrows use of color enhances the impact of this scene.More than any other war until then, the Vietnam conflict was brought to American citizens through the eyes of photojournalists. Their poignant and arresting imagery in magazines likeLifeandLook,television, and newspapers gave Americans an unromantic vision of daily warfare. Burrows and three other photojournalists lost their lives five years later when their helicopter was shot down en route to cover the war's expansion into Laos.",

The prostitute's deep absorption in her card game contrasts sharply with the soldier's furtive glance. Does he gaze at her cards or down the back or the front of her loose dress? With careless strokes, Edgar Degas quickly defined the woman's fleshy body and the man's broad form. Fascinated by the numerous gestures that reveal social class and sentiment, Degas focused his art on situations that only genre painters had fully used before, such as the class tensions between a man and a woman or the undercurrent of violence and domination in an affair.Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year, Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the \u00c9cole Militaire. She later falls in love with a soldier and murders him in a rage.",

Much of the heightening that probably once covered the angel's wings and clothing has suffered some surface damage and is now gone.

        "description":"Incorporated into this image is a self-portrait of the photographer himself, who posed on the steps of the subway station entrance to Times Square.This is one of forty-seven images that make up the series Habitat 7. Using an 8 x 10-inch camera mounted on a tripod, Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao made numerous exposures over the course of several hours, adjusting it to expand his angle of vision or capture the changing light. After scanning his color negatives, Liao used digital editing software to stitch together a large-scale image that presents broad sweeps of information in minute detail. The resulting inkjet print is a complex, composite image that encapsulates the elements of time and movement.Since moving to New York in 1999, Liao has lived along the number 7 subway line, which connects Main Street in Flushing, Queens, to Times Square in Manhattan. Likening the train's path to the rivers around which ancient civilizations developed and flourished, Liao selected specific locations as both the subject and vantage point for his Habitat 7 series. The series \"transports\" viewers from Flushing to the east and moving westward through the neighborhoods of Corona Park, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Sunnyside before arriving in Manhattan. Each image creates a seamless whole, as does Liao's portrayal of the culturally and economically diverse communities that coexist harmoniously along the eight and a half miles of the train, sometimes referred to as the \"International Express.\"",

The four Japaneselacquerpanels date from the mid- to late 1600s and were created with a technique known askijimaki-e.For this type of lacquer, artisans sanded plain wood to heighten its strong grain and used it as thebackgroundof each panel. They then added the scenic elements of landscape, plants, and animals in raised lacquer. Although this technique was common in Japan, such large panels were rarely incorporated into French eighteenth-century furniture.HeavyIonicpilasters, whose copper-filled flutes give an added rich color and contrast to the gilt-bronzemounts, flank the panels.

        "description":"The Minotaur, a monster with a bull's head and a human body, was the son of the Cretan queen and a bull for which she had developed an irresistible passion. The Minotaur lived in a labyrinth on Crete and devoured human sacrifices of youths and maidens sent as tribute from Athens. When the Greek heroTheseusfinally killed the monster, he freed Athens from this horrible burden. The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur was very popular on Athenian vases in the late 500s B.C., possibly due to the Athenian connection with the myth. In this rendition, Theseus plunges his sword through the monster's neck while the freed youths and maidens watch. The youths are shown nude, in poses similar to those found on contemporarykouroi. In his depiction of the encounter, the artist stressed the Minotaur's bestial nature. The Minotaur's weapon is a rock, seen clutched in his hoof-like hand, whereas civilized Theseus fights with a sword. The back of the vase shows two youths mounted on horses, greeted by family members as they return home. Such a scene of returning youths and warriors was a frequent one in Athenian vase-painting. The youths may be mythological figures such as the Dioskouroi, or they may simply be mortals.",

In response to the Frenchpointilliststyle, Ensor usedpaletteknives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colors with expressive freedom. He made several preparatory drawings for the painting, including one in the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection.Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer--a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, andcaricatures. Public, historical, andallegoricalfigures along with the artist's family and friends made up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the center of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functioned as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed--a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littr\u00e9, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton leading on the eager, mindless crowd.After rejection byLes XX,the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929. Ensor displayedChrist's Entryprominently in his home and studio throughout his life. With its aggressive,painterlystyle and merging of the public with the deeply personal,Christ's Entrywas a forerunner of twentieth-centuryExpressionism.",

Her very fast life had been filled with yachts, discotheques, costly resorts, designer clothes, an early marriage to an older man, and a fairly swift divorce. As the oldest of the prince's three children, she had served as \"first lady\" of Monaco since her mother's tragic death in an automobile accident the previous fall. Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck. The lighting on her face cast a deep shadow, creating strong chiaroscuro in 1940s film noir style; along with her downward gaze, the lighting made her appear remote and imperious.",

He used a magnesium lamp, visible in the lower right corner of the image.Six or seven million skeletons were interred in the catacombs; in this photograph, seemingly every one is accounted for. Only sixteen carefully stacked protruding skulls on the wall are clearly distinguishable at left, yet they are all that is needed to indicate what the blackened squares in the distance represent.Around the time that Nadar made this series of a hundred photographs in the catacombs, two of his beloved friends passed away. The photographer may have been exploring his own mortality when he embarked upon this series, but it was also a fashionable pursuit to descend into these macabre depths. In mid-nineteenth century Paris, there were four annual visiting days for the catacombs, at which time they were filled with curious onlookers.",

Its form and decoration combine elements from a variety of sources. The palmettes and Ionic capitals come from ancient Greek art, while lotus petals and lion's-paw feet are inspired by Egyptian motifs. The furniture, designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi, was executed by Gabriele Capello, nicknamed Il Moncalvo, and other craftsmen.The sophisticated inlaid decoration was made using an innovative technique that allowed the craftsmen to quickly create a smooth, uniform surface.

His exercises in different painting techniques are seen in the way he softened the outlines of forms and the manner in which he explored the descriptive possibilities of brushstrokes: broad and flat in the tablecloth, sketchy in the apples, and short and dense in the flower petals. Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other. These pictorial innovations became the foundation for the development of the Impressionist technique in the decades that followed.",

To prevent the infant twins from claiming the throne, a man who had deposed her father as king ordered the infants drowned in the river Tiber. The basket in which they were placed, however, safely floated down the river and landed at the future site of Rome. There a she-wolf, an animal sacred to Mars, took care of them until a herdsman named Faustulus discovered them. In theminiature, the tightly swaddled twins lie by the side of the Tiber. The she-wolf hovers protectively over them at the left, while Faustulus approaches from the right. The great city of Rome, which the twins will eventually found, stands in splendor in the middle of the miniature, while two men, perhaps Romulus and Remus as adults, hunt with their hawks to the far right.",

        "description":"At first glance, the subject of this photograph is difficult to identify, but the pattern of holes arranged in concentric circles gives it away. To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.",

Ultimately, she was killed by a dagger through her throat.Fra Paolino outlined the figure of the saint with black chalk, quickly correcting the lines of drapery at her back until he achieved the line he desired.

        "description":"Thisplein air(made outdoors) oil sketch by Jean-Victor Bertin captures the graceful curve of a sunlit bridge on the outskirts of a French village in the early 1800s. A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio. This sketch was meant to inform those polished yet imaginary landscapes, making them more convincing to the eye.",

In drawings such as this one, he worked out the structure of a composition using clear strokes that captured the figures' essential gestures or shapes. He then toned down the movement, gesture, and tumult in the final painting. This is a typical development for most painters, but one even more conspicuous in Poussin's work.

Given a papal dispensation that allowed their pigs to roam freely in medieval towns, the order took on the animal as itsemblem. Alone in his cave, the saint holds his prayer beads. This, along with his ecstatic facial expression, suggests that he is in the midst of fervent prayer. As in the other miniatures of the saints in thisbook of hours, Saint Anthony serves as a devotional model for themanuscript'sreaders, who are stimulated toward pious meditation as they read the prayer to him on the facing page.Crivelli set Anthony's peaked cave in a fantastic landscape that bears little resemblance to northern Africa, but the leafless trees and the barren ground do suggest a bleak wilderness. A winding stream connectsforegroundandbackground, and vivid pinks and oranges heighten the mystical spirituality of the scene.",

        "description":"As soon as they were installed in 1534, Michelangelo's sculptures for the Medici Mausoleum in Florence captured the attention of other artists. One of those artists, Agnolo Bronzino, made this drawing as a study of the right hand of one of those sculptures. With precision he copied the crisscross pattern of the accentuated veins and even the square thumbnail.In order to make this study, Bronzino must somehow have raised himself to the level of the hand, since it is drawn straight on and close-up and not from a low viewpoint. Perhaps he used steps to gain a better view or made the study from a cast of the hand. He combined more than one view of the three-dimensional hand, including both the upper surface of the thumb and the bulging muscle along the lower contour of the hand, which in reality cannot be seen at the same time. This gave difficulties when he tried to foreshorten the crooked forefinger, and faint traces of an early attempt still remain.In contrast to the careful presentation on the recto, the draftsman swiftly and spontaneously sketched four heads on the verso of this sheet.",

Asatyrplaying an aulos approaches Dionysos from the right. Contrasting formally and iconographically with the ideal white god, his bestial acolyte is painted completely in theblack-figure technique. Thus, the satyr's anatomical markings are rendered by incision, rather than drawn with gloss.Because Dionysos was the god of wine, his activities were typically set in vineyards. Here, the grapevines are outlined byrelieflines and colored with golden dilutewash. The bunches of grapes that hang from the vines are rendered in relief. Such three-dimensional grapes, common in LateArchaicred-figure vase-painting, are unprecedented in white ground representations.A pioneer in the development of the red-figure style of vase-painting, Euphronios seems to have turned to potting later in his career. By the variety of shapes with which he is associated, we know that he potted vessels of exceptional size and complexity, including vases that combined the wheel-thrown, mold-made, and hand-formed techniques.",

As he typically did, Saftleven included cooking implements and other bits carelessly strewn about and evoked a mood of enchantment by setting the scene in a shadowy vaulted interior with flying bats.

Giuseppe Maria Crespi's strong modeling of the saint's body and drapery gives him additional power. The artist crafted thecompositionwith bold lines of red chalk, and the cross-hatched lines of shadow accentuate the impression of a varied play of light over the monumental sculptural form.Crespi usually made less-finished drawings than this work, which leads scholars to guess that this drawing may have been intended as a design for an etching or engraving.",

A tireless chronicler of his time, Saint-Aubin surely would have viewed these dances and theatrical performances on the outskirts of Paris. Drawing on the wit and meticulous observation seen in Dutch paintings of peasants in the 1500s and 1600s, Saint-Aubin refined the rustic folk in a characteristically French Rococo treatment.",

        "description":"At first glance, this drawing of a frog appears to be a closely observed study of the natural world. Jacques de Gheyn II meticulously recorded the amphibian's long hind legs and loose skin. But on closer inspection the frog was clearly imbued with human characteristics. Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left \"hand\" grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects. This small study was probably part of a much larger sheet covered with other fantastical images. Collectors considered such sheets marvels of virtuosity and imaginative power.",

Small spherical pearls hang from the ends of the foliage, suspended from small loops so that they could swing freely. In the Renaissance, goldsmiths began to experiment with a variety of new cuts for gemstones. A table-cut stone rests on top of the owl's head, and three others lie along the branch at the bird's feet. The intricate and unusual cuts of the jewels on either side of the owl, in the shape of a quatrefoil and a rosette, suggest that someone commissioned this drawing to show a possible setting for actual stones.Contemporary paintings and drawings reveal that pendants were among the most popular forms of jewelry in the Renaissance. Women in particular favored pendants, wearing them suspended from a chain around their necks or pinned to a sleeve, where the dangling pearls and sparkling gemstones would catch the eye with their movement and brilliance.",

Biographer Giorgio Vasari explained that when Taddeo returned to Rome, his cousin Francesco il Sant'Angelo sought him out and they began to work together on many commissions. Francesco recommended him to a Roman nobleman, Jacopo Mattei, and suggested that Taddeo paint the first two subjects to prove his artistic talent when Mattei thought the artist too young. Taddeo sits precariously on a scaffolding painting the facade, with two allegories of Fame flying above. The Three Graces stand around him with Allegories of Spirit and Pride. Although the frescoes are still unfinished in the drawing, the most famous painters in Rome already flock to see them. Michelangelo arrives on horseback with his servant and two of his followers, and Vasari is deep in conversation with Francesco Salviati on the far right. Completed in 1548, the facade was hailed as a masterpiece by the leading artists in Rome, and it cemented the young Taddeo's reputation.",

These beams, as well as a third vertical form, have pointed tops suggestive of spears. Positioned on top of these beams, a single horizontal beam demarcates the tent's top edge. This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects. Noguchi desired his three-dimensional forms to animate space and positively alter the viewer's experience of the environment.",

In this preparatory drawing for the book, de Gheyn strove to create the illusion of a living soldier, carefully modeled in the round and exhibiting a wealth of detail both in costume and weaponry. Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike. Count Johann II of Nassau-Siegen commissioned the text to give the Dutch army a set of clear and systematic military procedures for training soldiers. In the final edition, each image also contained a description of the action shown and its associated commands.",

        "description":"Dreams are a frightening and dangerous state during which the dreamer is most vulnerable. Dreaming is an escape into a different world, into the unknown.This statement, by a historian who interviewed Manuel Alvarez Bravo, relays some of the ideas the artist may have considered while making this wistful portrait of young girl standing on a balcony with the sunlight innocently caressing her right shoulder. Perhaps Alvarez Bravo was trying to guess the girl's thoughts, as she stood immersed in her reverie, clearly unaware of his presence and indeed vulnerable to his camera. The dream world was of great importance to the Surrealists, whose work influenced Alvarez Bravo. Many of his early images explore the themes of sleep, dreams, and eroticism.",

Tamayo, a mural painter, saw Alvarez Bravo's work in a 1928 exhibition. It was the first time Alvarez Bravo exhibited his photographs. Interested in reactions, he stood nearby hoping to eavesdrop on a conversation. Two people stood talking, then approached Alvarez Bravo. One of the individuals was Tamayo. He was the first artist to respond to Alvarez Bravo's work, and the two shared a close friendship from that moment forward.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser",

Guido Reni emphasized the Holy Family's humanity and the infant's love and neediness, not his divinity as the Christ. Although a lightly drawn Joseph and an angel look on, they do not inhabit the same space as the more substantial mother and child, and neither Mary nor Jesus acknowledges their presence.Scholars are uncertain about the purpose of this drawing. The hatched lines indicating shading hint that Reni may have made it with an etching in mind, though none survives. He at least considered an oval format, for his curved lines round off all four corners of the design, echoing Mary's embracing arms and bowed head.",

The son of a Parisian jeweler, he studied animal anatomy thoroughly in books, in laboratories, and at the zoo. When a lion died, he and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix dissected it. Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye. His connection with Nadar was probably established through the painters who were friends of both. Barye was seldom photographed, and this image by Nadar, one of the few existing portraits, was later used as the basis for an etching.",

Some even believed that they were the work of the devil. The steam, smoke, and sparks emitted from the belly of these monsters caused a great deal of anxiety for timid souls. Eventually people grew accustomed to the invention and happily traveled for days on trains pulled by steam engines like this Central Pacific Railroad locomotive.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M. Naef",

To emphasize the vast distance of the mountains and town in the background, the Monogrammist M.S. sketched in only the barest of outlines indicating the far-off trees with tiny ovals. The drawing's high level of finish and prominent monogram and date indicate that he may have made it as a gift for a friend.Hunting scenes of this type were extremely popular in German art of the 1500s.

Ingres chose a pose that combined the informality of youth and the self-assurance of his subject's aristocratic origins. Grantham, who commissioned this portrait himself, stands confidently against a distant view ofSaint Peter's Basilica, an important site for Grand Tourists and one that Ingres often included in portraits.Ingres made this drawing when he was a struggling young artist living in Rome, earning his living by drawing portraits of wealthy visitors to the city.",

        "description":"Pieter Coecke van Aelst combined various scenes into a continuous narrative that proceeds left to right like a cartoon strip. The prodigal son takes leave of his father, lavishes his money on worldly pleasures at a brothel, gets chased away by prostitutes, lands in a pigsty, and finally reconciles with his father. In the 1500s, this popular parable taught about the sin of extravagance and the virtue of forgiveness. In contrast to the text of the Bible, which emphasizes the father's final act of forgiveness, artists and patrons of that period often focused lively attention on the brothel scene. Coecke set it further forward than the rest of the action, with the detailed landscape and architectural passages of the other episodes forming an elaborate backdrop. Emphasizing attractive outlines, he filled the entire drawing with elegantly proportioned figures. Scholars believe that the drawing's large scale and horizontal format suggest that Coecke might have made it as a tapestry design.",

        "description":"If my work must be limited to watercolor, pastel, or anything else all the spirit goes out of it ... I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive \"printings,\" Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of \"the fall of man\" enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.",

Dressing herself so as to catch the eye of any man who might see her, Judith entered the enemy camp and quickly entranced the general with her beauty. He invited her to his tent with plans to seduce her, but became too drunk. She was therefore able to grab his sword and sever his head.The decapitated body of Holofernes, with its gushing wound, lies on a canopied bed in the elaborate tent to the right.

In the distance, the other Assyrian tents cluster outside the city walls, while the army marches up to the gate.Van Heemskerck's careful cross-hatching and neat penwork indicate that this was a final version of this drawing.

The orange-red diagonal shape resembles a flame with whitish edges, with surrounding hues ranging from cream to black. These colors indicate the presence of salt-eating microbacteria, representing a stage in the lake's annual cycle of flooding and drying out. Garnett made at least 100 images of Owens Lake during his career as an aerial photographer. Many of his commercial clients included geological and chemical industries, and the lake--located in the Mojave Desert--was along one of his frequent flight paths.Subjects like Owens Lake demonstrate Garnett's lifelong concern for the conservation of natural resources.

Clearly proud of his abilities as adaguerreotypist, he leaned one half of one of his panoramas of Geneva against his top hat. The color applied to his face and hands and the flower in his buttonhole was meant to heighten the appearance of reality and is unusual in Eynard's daguerreotypes.",

It focused on the lives of three cotton tenant farming families living in Hale County, Alabama. Frank Tengle, whom Agee called Fred Ricketts in the book, appears here in close-up, the deep, furrowed lines of his weathered face echoing the horizontal stripes of the clapboard siding on the shack against which he stands. He wears his work clothes; the stubble on his chin and oily disarray of his hair suggest that the photograph was made during or toward the end of Tengle's work day. The harsh sun against his face seems almost like an assault upon an already battered soul.",

Various types of flowers that would not bloom in the same season appear together here: roses, forget-me-nots, lilies-of-the-valley, a cyclamen, a violet, a hyacinth, and tulips. Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty.A rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany. Bosschaert was the first great Dutch specialist in fruit and flower painting and the head of a family of artists. He established a tradition that influenced an entire generation of fruit and flower painters in the Netherlands.",

Stephen, who lived at the time of Jesus, was the first martyr to sacrifice his or her life in the name of Christianity. This illumination closely follows the biblical story--showing that Stephen's devotion continued through prayers that he recited during his torment.To heighten the impact of the drama, the illuminator depicted the stones both in the hands of the attackers and actually striking Stephen's body. The saint's face, however, betrays no fear, so sure is he of Jesus' saving power. In the upper segment of the letterS,Saul, who later converted and became Saint Paul, crouches on the discarded robes of the false witnesses who testified against Stephen. Despite the scene's violence, the artist takes delight in the elegant pivot of the first tormentor, the decorative scrolls on the letter and on the saint's gown, and in the tooling--small decorative dots punched in the gold leaf--of Stephen's halo.",

Probably a milliner's display head sporting a chic, bobbed hairstyle, the ceramic face stands in silent witness to the cluttered fate of the culture's cast-offs during the Great Depression. Walker Evans was frequently drawn to such incongruous, surreal scenes, in which an unlikely element appears out of its original context and thereby assumes a new relationship to the objects around it.",

        "description":"Brett Weston saw something interesting in the most commonplace subjects, which he often transformed into abstract arrangements of pattern and texture in his prints. By moving in close to eliminate context, Weston de-emphasized the cultural significance of his often-humble subjects.Here, Weston played with the viewer's sense of three-dimensional space by focusing on a window with lace curtains and potted plants, and the reflection of a building from across the street. He positioned the camera in such a way that the flowers embroidered on the curtain appear to be sprouting from the pots sitting on the window's ledge.The reflection of the photographer's camera is seen in the lower right hand corner-a dark shape with rounded corners and a tripod leg that appears to jut from the plant container on the far right.The scene is easily recognizable, but it takes a moment to understand the relationship between the various parts. This sort of ambiguity is what makes Weston's photographs intriguing.",

A large cloak trimmed with fur surrounds her body, so that only her head, hunched shoulders, and large feet in their wooden shoes remain uncovered. A broad hat shelters her face, seen only in sharp profile. Roelandt Savery concentrated on broadly outlining the figure's position and the folds of fabric that obscure her body. He ignored more minute details such as the design of her hat or the form of her stool, suggesting only the general form of each.This drawing comes from a series of studies similar in subject and style. On many of the sheets, although not this one, the artist inscribed the wordsnaer het leven, which may suggest that each scene was drawn from life rather than from the artist's imagination. At a time when most drawings were prepared in the studio, this fact was unusual enough to be worth noting. The notations surrounding the figure suggest possible colors, perhaps for use in a painting.",

Prince Meleager succeeded in killing the vicious boar that was let loose in the kingdom of Calydon, but he presented the honor of the hide to his love, the sole woman on the hunt, who had first wounded the boar. Outraged that a woman should receive the honor, Meleager's maternal uncles tried to take the hide for themselves, but Meleager killed them in a fit of rage. When Althea heard that her son had killed her brothers, she plotted to kill Meleager, but he had already repented of his act by taking his own life.

Here the greenpastelin the vegetation and the white chalk above it billow around Venus like a veil of smoke, complementing the soft, yielding fleshy bodies that Boucher created with a thick application of white chalk.Throughout his long career, Boucher made two to three drawings a day, producing approximately ten thousand known works ranging from quick sketches to finished compositions like this one.",

A dark horizontal beam cuts across the upper third of the photograph, slicing a recessed path across Ernst's eyes that gives the illusion of a mask.

        "description":"In this narrativehistory painting, Joseph Mallord William Turner expressed the power of nature and the heroism of man through the eyes of aRomanticpainter. Turner used quick, slanting brushstrokes to describe the stormy sky. The application of scumbled white paint suggests churning, turbulent seas and the heavy spray of waves hitting the ship's bow. Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673. In perhaps a symbolic overture signaling his submission to authority, Tromp is shown, in Turner's words, \"going about to please his Masters.\"",

Red chalk had long been popular for drawing the human figure and for rendering pinkish-tan flesh tones because of its rosy color. By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support. The combination of red, white, and black chalk is a technique known by French term coined in the 1700s,aux trois crayons.On the verso, Corneille drew theMadonna and Child with Saint John Seated in a Landscapein pen and ink, suggesting tonal areas with brownwashand black chalk. The copying of figures from the recto and the more complete nature of the composition suggest that the verso drawing was made after the recto. The interior framing lines and the precise outlined figures suggest that this drawing was made in preparation for an engraving.",

Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns. Bayard filled the entire sheet of paper, creating a catalog of specimens that reveals the basic structure of each flower, leaf, feather, and scrap of fabric.",

This watercolor probably records a momentary impression created while at leisure, but it may also have served as a study for the background of a painting.

In his hands, the airplane became an artistic tool. The majority of Garnett's photographs were taken at low speeds, while he balanced the wheel with his elbow and manipulated the rubber pedals with his feet. The stillness of his work belies the fact that it was photographed while he was in motion.",

But Magdaleine does not appear quite as at ease as her husband, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois, in a companion portrait. She sits straight upright, her back parallel to, but not quite touching, the chair behind her.With both hands, Magdaleine grasps a large gray-blue cat that bemusedly engages the viewer. Because of its large size and distinctive coloration, the cat can be identified as achartreux,one of the oldest and most cherished French breeds. Jean-Baptiste Perronneau included feline companions in several of his portraits of female subjects, reinforcing the elegance and sophistication of his sitters. Here, the bells on thechartreux'scollar echo the pearls around Magdaleine's neck, suggesting that cat and sitter alike are refined objects for visual delectation.",

Ligozzi probably painted this sheet as part of a book devoted to figures in Turkish costume, many of whom are accompanied by animals. Rather than drawing from life, he used a variety of costume engravings.Ligozzi seems to have invented the idea of showing animals alongside the costumed figures. Throughout his book, the animals often act as commentaries on the figures or reflect physiognomic similarities; here, heads turned to the right and the finely drawn human and feline whiskers link the azappo and the cheetah.Ligozzi's patron, Francesco I de'Medici, probably commissioned the series. During the late 1500s, wealthypatronsinterested in science and exploration often hired artists to paint elaborate, colored illustrations offlora, fauna, and the peoples of foreign lands.",

Also in a historicizing vein, his younger brother John wears a dress, traditionally worn by both boys and girls until they reached four years of age, and holds a wicker basket full of colorful summer blossoms. Francis Cotes captured his sitters with disarming directness. Joseph bears himself gracefully and engages the viewer with his gaze, yet he still retains the fragile self-reserve typical of an older boy. His brother John, however, caught in three-quarter view, moves and smiles with the unselfconscious spontaneity of a four-year-old. The contrast between the two boys' ages, clothing, and actions indicates that the subject is more than a likeness of two children--it serves as a commentary on the passage of childhood.",

The Affecter put so little emphasis on thenarrativecontent of his work that scholars often have difficulty determining precisely what is being depicted. For example, some scholars interpret the figures on the back of the vase as dancing, while others see a scene of courtship. Nonetheless, all the figures are beautifully drawn with dramatic silhouettes emphasized by long angular limbs. This vase stands outside the normal stylistic trends for Athens and was probably designed for export to Etruria. TheEtruscansimported large quantities of Greek vases, and certain Athenian artists appear to have focused on this market, adapting their product to Etruscan taste.",

While the mother urges her child to hand the purse to the old man, anunand two young men wait their turn to extend charity. Jean-Baptiste Greuze portrayed the mother and daughter in fine clothing to emphasize the disparity between their lives and that of the impoverished couple, whose only valuable possession, a sword, is prominently displayed behind them. Greuze was famous for moralizing images like this one, which were meant to illustrate the importance of good deeds and childhood instruction in a domestic setting. InThe Charitable Woman,a complex scene that explores a wide range of human expression, he used spontaneous applications of wash to intensify the sense of drama.Greuze producedThe Charitable Womanas a compositional study for a painting of the same name,now in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon. Prior to making this drawing, he made numerous studies of individual figures, such as theStudy of the Head of an Old Woman,who is one of the principal characters in this scene. These carefully rendered drawings provide evidence of Greuze's working methods and testify to his careful preparation.",

In contrast to the sentimentality and usually smooth brushwork of his paintings, Murillo's drawings display fluidity and spontaneity.Known and admired for his idealized portrayals of children, Murillo often drew and painted scenes of the infancy of Christ, here identified by a shepherd's staff.

Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist.

His powerful sculptural form and sense of monumentality derive from ancient Roman sculpture and Renaissance art, especially Michelangelo's Sistine Chapelignudi, while the use of black and white chalks on blue-gray paper reflects Agostino Carracci's interest in Venetian art of the 1500s.Agostino Carracci made this drawing as a study for a triton in his fresco,Thetis Borne to the Wedding Chamber of Peleus, also known asGalatea. The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the body's essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one.",

Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer. The solid weight of the figures and the frame contrasts with the delicacy of the fine sprays of leaves and flowers extending from the frame.",

Her loosely draped blue silk dress reveals the creamy skin of her chest and neck. In a pose both sensual and elegant, with her head slightly turned, Louise de Keroualle looks down at the viewer as she plays with a thick, lush strand of her abundant hair. Her features--almond-shaped eyes, gently arched eyebrows, a straight nose, and full red lips--epitomized ideal beauty of the late 1600s.Louise de Keroualle, who worked as a spy forLouis XIV, came to England from France as a Maid of Honour to the sister of King Charles II in 1670. Soon afterward, she became Charles's favorite mistress, and in 1673 he created for her the position of Duchess of Portsmouth. She used her influence to strengthen the friendship between Charles II and Louis XIV.",

        "description":"Although Michelangelo Buonarroti used the theme of the Madonna and Child many times during his life, here he chose to represent a variant of the motif, one not specifically related in the Bible but commonly depicted by artists in the 1400s and 1500s. The infant Saint John the Baptist and two angels join the Holy Family on an interlude in their flight into Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of Jewish male newborns. To the right, a lightly drawn donkey grazes; the angels are barely discernible at the top left. The focus of attention, however, is the central group of the Virgin and the two children.Michelangelo achieved a solid, sculptural effect by using a combination of different media drawn on top of each other: underdrawing with a stylus, black and then red chalk, followed by pen and brown ink. Finely modulated hatching and cross-hatching enhances the figures' sense of three-dimensionality. Changes reflecting Michelangelo's creative working methods are visible in the head of the Virgin, which is positioned simultaneously looking downwards to the left and upwards to the right.",

        "description":"When Jules Martial Regnault, called de Pr\u00e9maray, sat for Nadar in 1857, the two men had known each other for about fifteen years. Before his sitting, de Pr\u00e9maray wrote to Nadar for advice on the most appropriate clothing for the photograph, suggesting the importance Nadar placed on apparel in his portraits. Whether de Pr\u00e9maray's velvet smock belonged to him or to Nadar is uncertain, but it seems large for the writer's frail figure and the sleeves appear to have been turned back at the wrists, creating deep satin cuffs.On the back of his photographs, Nadar customarily wrote the professions of his sitters; he designated de Pr\u00e9maray as a theatrical critic rather than as the playwright he also was. The deep circles under de Pr\u00e9mary's eyes may be symptoms of the severe illness that soon necessitated a three-year course of hydrotherapeutic treatments. By 1859 the critic's precarious health had forced him to give up all kinds of writing, and he died nine years later at age forty-nine.",

The later drawings are all much more lightly shaded with pale strokes of wash, and each profile wears an elaborate, fanciful hat or headdress and an exaggerated expression approaching caricature. These figures may represent costumed characters in a ballet or theatrical display.

After the death of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., control of the Roman state was divided between his heirsOctavianand Marc Antony, sparking a Roman civil war. Antony allied himself with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra against Octavian. After their horrendous defeat at Actium in 31 B.C., Cleopatra and Antony fled to Egypt, where they both committed suicide, he with a sword, she with poisonous snakes. According to Boccaccio, Octavian had their tombs placed side by side.The Boucicaut Master recreated their tombs as a single structure in the EuropeanGothicstyle, rather than as Egyptian monuments. The effigies display the implements of their deaths, the sword and the snake.",

        "description":"As a boy, Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault loved drawing horses and would sit in the stables watching and drawing. In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede. G\u00e9ricault used virtually monochromatic colors applied in thick swirls to animate and suggest extreme physical strength. The dramatic use of light and shadow adds energy to the relieflike scene. G\u00e9ricault mythologized the event: the muscular nude in the center recalls athletes of ancient Greece, and the thrusting horses bring to mind the Parthenonfriezedesigned by Phidias. G\u00e9ricault intended to use this study for a grand painting to submit to theSalon, but he had to abandon that plan when he was called back to France on short notice.",

Through industry and intrigue, he rose to become the most powerful person in France after KingLouis XV, amassing a great fortune and spending it extravagantly on, among other things, an outstanding collection of paintings. Choiseul helped launch the career of Hubert Robert, whose father was Choiseul's father's valet, by finding him a post as cook in theAcad\u00e9mie de Francein Rome. Choiseul was once characterized as \"a wonderful mixture of selfishness and charm and recklessness and exquisite taste.\" In 1770 Louis XV fired the duke, who retreated to the Choiseul estate, Chanteloup, in the Touraine region of central France.Here, the dedicated womanizer Choiseul is shown in exile with his mistress Madame de Brionne and the Abb\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy, the learned curator of the king's collection of antiquities and a close friend and adviser of the duke and his duchess.

        "description":"A youth bends over to scrape his shin with a curved blade called a strigil. After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property. The ring in which this scaraboid is set is modern. As small, personal items, gems were easy to carry; although this example was made in the Cyclades, it was found in Sicily.",

Is this the gay, jovial work some people would have us believe in?

When he exhibitedMan with a Hoeat theSalonof 1862, it quickly became one of the most controversial pictures of mid-1800s France. He probably made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor that painting, now also in the Getty Museum.In this drawing, Millet concentrated on the man, showing his face as less brutish, less exhausted, and more defined than in the finished painting. He used subtle additions of white chalk to render the clouds in the sky and the sun'shighlightson the farmer's shirt. Drawn on buff paper, the entire scene has a soft, hazy quality achieved with a technique known as stumping.",

        "description":"In this sensitive portrait, a young woman, her face haloed by a cloud of hair, reclines on a chaise lounge and gazes languidly at the viewer. In contrast to the high degree of finish in his rendering of the head, Klimt treated the sitter's clothing and the back of the chair in a looser, more summary manner, highlighting the palpable emotional connection between sitter and artist.The young woman bears a noticeable resemblance to Sonja Knips, a Viennese socialite whose portrait Klimt painted during the same period. Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession. It is a fine example of Klimt's commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).",

        "description":"The young man on the left gazes steadily outward, capturing the viewer's interest with his direct stare. His features seem more realistic, more like a portrait than the other, obviously imaginary figures, and his position squarely facing the viewer also isolates him. The care with which Jacques de Gheyn II rendered the boy's fanciful costume also contrasts with the other heads. Paying close attention to the fall of light, de Gheyn evoked the textures of the youth's clothing--especially the turban--with beautiful, varied penwork that demonstrates the creases and gathers. He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head. He seems to have been one of the first artists to mingle figures drawn from nature with those from his imagination.  Scholars believe that these studies may have been cut from a larger sheet, with the triangular patch at the bottom added at that time.",

My belief in the meaning of abstract expression came from my love of music. And my use of metaphor comes out of my experience of poetry and literature.Made in the abandoned mining town of Jerome, Arizona, this photograph of cracked and peeling paint by Aaron Siskind has an almost musical rhythm that echoes the influences he discussed in the statement above. In Siskind's close-up view, the paint is transformed from the reality of decay into abstracted, multi-layered textures and tones formed by shadow and reflection. Seen in more selective detail than the eye registers at a glance, the paint becomes a metaphor of the passage of time and the impermanence of place.",

        "description":"Milton Rogovin photographed inhabitants of the Lower West Side district of Buffalo, New York, over a period of twenty years. The process allowed the photographer and the viewer to witness the development of several families. In thistriptych, Rogovin illustrated the evolution of one family. In the first frame, Eva appears as a single mother, not far removed from childhood herself. Mother and daughter, both heavily bundled against the cold, stand on the grimy, littered sidewalk, suggesting, perhaps, that on this first encounter the photographer was not invited into the private space of their home.The second photograph shows Eva and her daughter standing in front of the television set at home, surrounded by familial and religious images. Their age difference seems so small that they could be mistaken for sisters. The final photograph, made nineteen years after the first, portrays Eva as a grandmother and her daughter as a mother of three. Their surroundings are now considerably richer with personal effects, connoting a more comfortable and secure home life.",

Two gentlemen ride in comfort, chatting animatedly as the postilion riding on the near horse guides the team of horses. By using a lighter tone for the middle distance, where another group of travelers descends the hill, Ricci conveyed the expansive feeling of traveling by carriage in the open air and hinted at the balmy atmosphere. Drawing even more lightly, he suggested a town in the background as a destination.Scholars are uncertain whether Ricci made this composition as a study for a painting or print or an independent, finished work of art. He repeated the same scene with differing details and a higher viewpoint in a later painting. Two etchings, including one made posthumously by Ricci's nephew, repeat the drawing's design almost exactly.",

For me, it was a long process realizing that this does not have to be the case.When making his two photocollages of Pearblossom Highway, David Hockney positioned himself closer to or more distant from his subjects, choosing which elements in the scene should be large and which should be small. By reassembling views from multiple perspectives, he applied ideas borrowed from Cubist painting to produce a rich, compound image that he considers \"a panoramic assault on Renaissance one-point perspective.\"Hockney made this work as a preparatory study for the final version,Pearblossom Hwy., 11 -  18th April 1986, #2,which measures approximately six-and-a-half by nine feet. Aside from scale, the principal differences between the two versions are the distortion of the stop sign in the foreground and the left and right edges of the composition.",

Sabatini's application of chalk ranges from crisp lines for contours and accents to soft modeling for his face and sleeve. His variety enhances the sensuous quality of the black chalk, giving the viewer a strong sense of its texture and feel.Gaspare Redi, a copyist and mount-maker, created the ornamental frame, or cartouche. Florentine nobleman Francesco Maria Niccol\u00f2 Gabburri, who assembled a large series of drawn portraits and self-portraits of artists, hired them both. Gabburri probably requested that Sabatini use the oval format, which he preferred for his collection. The tradition of collectors using ornamental frames to set off their drawings began with Giorgio Vasari. Unlike Vasari, who decorated a separate sheet to use as hismount, Redi used the same paper as Sabatini, allowing for a better integration of image and the surrounding decorative frame.",

A member of the Orl\u00e9ans nobility, Pinceloup de la Grange had recently received several prestigious government appointments. The painting and a pendant portrait of the sitter's wife may have been intended to celebrate his achievement.The portrait was painted near the outset of Jean-Baptiste Perronneau's career. Primarily working in the medium of pastel, Perronneau was one of the most prominent and accomplished portraitists in eighteenth-century France. He was especially successful in securing patrons, like Pinceloup de la Grange, in the French provinces.",

        "description":"As the first of his twelve Labors, the Greek heroHerakleshad to slay theNemean Lion, a monstrous beast with an impenetrable hide that was ravaging the countryside around the city of Nemea. Since weapons were of no use against the creature, Herakles' only option was to strangle it. Herakles battling the Nemean Lion was the most frequently depicted mythological scene in Greek art. In early depictions, Herakles stands facing the lion, but by the late 500s B.C., the combatants were depicted down on the ground, stretched out in opposite directions.On this Athenianred-figurekalpis, a tree bends over Herakles and the lion, a rare example of landscape elements in Greek art. Throughout theArchaicperiod and into the earlyClassical, vase-painters focused so completely on the figures in theirnarrativescenes that they excluded almost all background elements. Scenes played out in a sort of visual vacuum without any setting at all. On this vase, for example, the tree serves only as a marker to indicate that the action takes place outdoors.The kalpis is the rounded form of ahydria, or water vessel, favored by red-figure artists in this period. The three handles of the shape facilitated pouring and lifting.",

The artist employed a warm, glowing palette of gold and orange, endowing the figure with a luminous quality appropriate to a holy person.The initial, cut from an antiphonal, probably introduced a generic text devoted to martyrs, which was individualized by the insertion of a particular saint's name. The saint shown is thus not a specific person but a composite martyr accompanied by the attributes of a number of saints who died for the Christian faith.  The wool comb at the figure's feet was an instrument used to torture Saint Blasius, the rocks could refer to the stoning of Saint Stephen, the fire may refer to Saint Lawrence who was roasted alive, and the swords could indicate any number of martyr saints.

Robert Howlett had been commissioned byThe Illustrated Timesto document its building and launching. In this photograph Howlett swung his camera away from the enormous ship to record the human reaction to the anticipated spectacle. The image has the casual structure of an unposedsnapshot. It was an illustration meant to accompany a newspaper account of the events. Looking nervously expectant, the men grouped around an imperious Brunel--the short man at the center front, facing right--on the dock were investors from the syndicate that had spent three million dollars for the ship's construction. Brunel did not want onlookers present, but the owners sold tickets and people came by the thousands. TheGreat Easternstubbornly refused to be moved down the launching ramp, and steam winch handles spun wildly out of control, killing two crewmembers and threatening the spectators. Several more months of pushing and pulling ensued before Brunel's ship was successfully waterborne.",

Sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi drew on this famous prototype for his marble bust of Caracalla. Carved during a period in which collectors bought sculpturesall' antica, this bust was probably intended for an English collector'sNeoclassicalgallery.Cavaceppi was best known for his restorations ofantiquesculpture rather than for his rare original works, such as this one.

She touches the ribbon around her neck with long fingers cupped near her heart --a shy gesture and nod to the garb of the 19th-century Romantic poets she admires. With quiet ferocity, the portrait hovers between masculine and feminine, strength and vulnerability.Intimately bonded in life and work, Mapplethorpe and Smith made this image for the cover of her debut rock album,Horses.It is one of his earliest celebrity portraits, a genre in which he went on to distinguish himself. He often amplified the glamour of his subjects, but modernized conventional portrayals with provocative depictions of race, gender, and sexuality. For example, record executives, concerned that Smith with her lack of makeup and messy hair wasn't conventionally pretty enough to sell records like other \"girl singers,\" wanted to airbrush this image. Knowing Mapplethorpe would back her up, Smith refused and the image and album shaped the start of both their iconoclastic careers.",

Gabriel, dressed in white with multi-colored wings, kneels and points towards the circular window above, indicating the presence of God. With his other hand he draws back the curtain of the canopy.Dieric Bouts painted the scene in a lucid and spatially convincing setting. The room at the left is simply described: a barrel ceiling, a marble column with two steps leading up to the room, and a stained glass window. A mood of solemnity, suitable for prayer, pervades the scene. In this somber setting Bouts's use of bright red for the drapery seems unusual. It may signify the Passion, forecasting the death of Christ, or it may be purely decorative since Bouts used this color in other compositions.The Annunciationbelongs to a set of five paintings that originally constituted a polyptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. It was probably the upper left panel of an altarpiece that included paintings of theAdoration of the Magi, Entombment(upper right),Resurrection(lower right), and perhaps theCrucifixionin the center.",

It is like others in the series, most of which are close-ups of her body, often with one of her abstract works of art serving as a background. The figure and background seem to blend seamlessly, forming an image that borders on abstraction.",

The main obstacle was the Tehachapi Mountains, outside of Los Angeles. Eighteen tunnels were required for the railroad to pass through this mountain range. The longest one, seen here, stretched for a mile and a half.  After 1860, the railroad was a persistent subject in Carleton Watkins's photographs. As a close friend of Collis P. Huntington, one of the executives responsible for thecreationof the Central Pacific Railroad and its extension, the Southern Pacific, Watkins traveled along the railways for many years with complimentary annual passes. He essentially functioned as an unofficial photographer of the railroads, often taking images on or near the new tracks.",

In the tradition of Gillis van Coninxloo, Savery believed that nature was more than merely a backdrop to human action; it could be the dramatic focus of a picture.Roelandt Savery probably drew this setting from his imagination, based on places he had seen on his travels in the Tyrol, a mountainous region in Austria and Italy. During the early 1600s, while in the service of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague, Savery traveled extensively in the eastern Alps, gathering many of themotifshe would use in his pictures for the rest of his life.

While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor with his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam observes the scene closely from a doorway on the right.Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas drew the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the \u00c9cole Militaire.

To make the story easier to follow, Biagio d'Antonio included inscriptions identifying the principal characters.In the left-hand loggia, Jacob, seated on a throne, sends Joseph to his half-brothers tending sheep in the field. In the far left corner, the brothers, jealous of their father's love for Joseph, strip him of his jacket and throw him into a pit. Passing merchants purchase the young boy from his brothers for twenty pieces of silver. In thebackgroundto the right, the merchants board the ship that will take them and their cargo to Egypt. In the right-hand loggia, the brothers show a blood-smeared coat to their father as evidence that Joseph is dead. With his head in his hand, Jacob mourns his son, whom he believes to be dead.A companion panel in the Metropolitan Museum of Art depicts the next sequence of events in Joseph's life. Originally framed next to one another, these two panels would have been inserted into the paneling of a room in a Tuscan family's home.",

On the interior of the cup, a boy holding a lyre stands in front of a bearded man, who must be his music teacher. On the outside, men and boys form similar scenes. The imagined walls of the schoolroom are hung with musical instruments and athletic equipment: lyres, string bags with knucklebones, sponges, andaryballoi. The scenes on this cup are not purely educational, however. On one side of the vase, a boy holds a hare on his lap, while on the other, a man offers a hare to another boy. In addition to serving as a classroom, the gymnasion in its role as the center of Greek physical and intellectual life was also the center of romantic courtship. Hares were popular love gifts in the homosexual relationships between older men and boys favored by the Athenian aristocracy in the early 500s B.C.",

Among Rubens's most richly worked drawings for theBrevarium,this scene is notable for its nocturnalillumination. To create the effect of evening, he bathed the entire page in tones of brownwash. He then used whitebodycolorto suffuse the onlookers in theChristChild's miraculous holy light, a concept ultimately derived from Correggio's art.In this sheet, Rubens's drawing betrays an artist who thinks primarily as a painter, softening outlines and building up shapes that then take on life and color. Even in this very finished drawing, he characteristically sacrificed detail to gain a sense of movement and energy.For twenty-five years, Rubens supplied his boyhood friend Balthasar Moretus, head of Antwerp's Plantin Press, with illustrations for books ranging from the philosophy of Seneca to a treatise on optics. Moretus informed him well in advance about the illustrations required; during this time, Rubens jotted down many ideas that he worked into designs for engravings, as in this drawing.",

        "description":"The maiden Europa rests atop a white bull, unaware it is the god Jupiter in disguise. According to the tale in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, soon the animal will abduct her across the waves. Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow. The romance is punctuated by long shadows coming in from the left, distinctive of his favorite afternoon light, which help frame the drama at center stage.",

In this portrait of her dear friend, Cameron sought to portray \"faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man.\" Cameron draped Herschel in a swath of dark cloth, which served to highlight his white hair and to focus attention on his face.

Finally, with moistened red chalk, he overlaid the second head with a rather abstract third one that leans even farther toward the bowl, similar to the smoker's pose on the recto. On the more finished recto, Helmbreker caught the fleeting actions of two youths, a smoker seemingly standing and sucking in his breath to light a pipe and a boy seated behind a table and leaning back to drink from a jug. The drinker's sidelong glance enhances the scene's spontaneous, lifelike feeling. Someone may have trimmed the sheet, reducing these figures from three-quarter-length to the present half-length.",

        "description":"One sunny day in the mid-1700s, Canaletto set up his easel in the inner courtyard of Warwick Castle to capture the activities there. Although the strong horizontal line of the architecture forms the focus of the drawing as it divides earth from sky, Canaletto also filled the scene with many intricate details. A huntsman walks across the courtyard, dressed in a long frock coat and three-cornered hat, his rifle slung over one shoulder and his dog trotting beside him. A couple stand conversing against the back wall, while another woman in a full skirt and white apron enjoys the sunshine underneath the tower on the right. The rooftops of the city below can be glimpsed through the arched gateway of the central gate. These small details not only give a sense of the wall's great height but also humanize the scene.Canaletto probably made this drawing as a preparatory study for a subsequent painting of the same subject. Although the painting contains more figures, it is very close to this drawing in every other respect.",

The two areas of focus in this drawing correspond to these two main characters, as yet separated--Christ in the center and the Canaanite woman in an exchange with an apostle at the left. The onlookers behind and beneath the woman and the indeterminate projection at the left add depth and foreground to the scene.Modeling his figures with fine hatching, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn displayed a wide variety in the width and character of his lines. Correcting and altering the composition as he worked, he partially blotted out one of the onlookers' faces and covered Christ's left hand and foot with whitebodycolor. The lightly sketched landscape at the right typifies Rembrandt's characteristic use of space and light, easily suggested with ink alone. In the 1640s, Rembrandt preferred to draw directly with pen and ink, unlike most of his contemporaries, who began their drawings with preliminary pencil or chalk sketches, then covered over those lines with ink.",

        "description":"Severe yet sensual, the Roman goddess of Love's well-modeled, undulating curls and upswept hair provide a delicate contrast to the unblemished skin which is polished to a high shine. Shown in a gesture of modesty as if suddenly surprised, she appears in a classic pose known as the \"chaste Venus\" or Medici Venus after a famous life-size Hellenistic marble. Her eyes are slightly textured giving them the appearance of depth.The artist's name is inscribed in Latin on the plinth, or supporting base, of the sculpture. TheVenus--along with Cipriani'sDancing Faun--was created for display at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, the seat or country house of the patron for these works. After casting, the artist destroyed the original plasters to prevent a second use, making the works even more extraordinary. Whereas many such sculptures were displayed unprotected outdoors in gardens, these were not. The condition of the bronze has therefore retained much of the freshness of its original appearance, without staining or pitting of the surface.Cipriani'sVenusis based on a Hellenistic statue that has been on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since the second half of the 1600's. Such copies of Greco-Roman statuary were popular among contemporary wealthy art collectors who wanted their own versions of ancient art seen during their travels in Europe and Greece on what was known as the \"grand tour.\" This particular sculpture, however, takes the \"souvenir\" type to the extreme, as it is a large, full-scale work, difficult to transport, and of such high artistic quality.In the marble version, the work features a support to Venus' leg in the form of a putto riding a dolphin. Cipriani eliminates this element, whose stability is not required in the bronze medium. Some scholars see his choice as possibly inspired by the notion that the ancient marbles were actually copies of lost bronze originals.",

Globes frequently adorned the libraries of the aristocracy, lending an air of scholarly respectability in an age when uncharted territories around the world were being mapped and new trade routes established. They frequently appeared in eighteenth-century portraits but were usually supported on simple turned columns. These examples, with their red and yellowlacqueredstands decorated with Chinese figures, are exceptionally elaborate and may have been made to match similarly lacquered furniture.A pair of globes on tripod stands similar to those in the Getty Museum's collection is reproduced in an engraving from 1740 of the library of a wealthy eighteenth-centuryfinancier, Joseph Bonnier de La Mosson. The second floor of his townhouse was devoted to a series of seven rooms, including a chemistry room with fountains and ovens; an apothecary; alatheroom; a room for his drug supplies; a room that housed his collection of minerals and rare animals, stuffed or in jars; and a room filled with machines and models relating to clockmaking, navigation, and hydraulics.",

This departure from his usual practice--a street-level perspective--suggests that he may have been commissioned to photograph this courtyard, where a leafless tree struggles upward as a living contrast to its crumbling surroundings.In a letter to the director of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Atget declared that his collection, meaning his prints and negatives, included \"all of Old Paris.\" To Atget, it was important not to record popular destinations and fashionable districts but to create \"artistic documents . . . of old hotels\" and \"historic or curious houses.\" These urban views were ideal images for his \"documents for artists,\" a collection of photographs available for purchase by artists as source material for their work.",

        "description":"There are two cream puffs sitting side-by-side, with a red cherry sitting on the top of each as a finishing touch to a great mound of delight. Each cream puff is fully loaded, with a shell acting as the base and an abundant amount of whipped cream rising generously from it. It all sits on pink, fake-fur fabric. It speaks of abundance, with the huge whipped-cream filling that swirls around the center of each puff.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called \"Forbidden Pleasures\"--occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements. Callis has said that these soft, sweet, colorful pastries, each lit and staged on a fabric of complimentary texture and design, is about the \"idea that desserts and eating desserts carries some of the same psychological baggage as guilt.\" In other words, eating rich desserts in this health-conscious time can be considered a crime of sorts. In these images, there is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to human sexuality. The seductive ingredients of the pastries and their fabric environments simulate the look of flesh. Although the motivation for this project may have been an impulsive urge to have fun with both the glossy Cibachrome medium and the subject of sweets, Callis was no doubt drawing on the tradition of abundance found in earlier still life painting and the extravagant color of more recent painters representing popular culture.",

The oversized, ragged clothes he wears suggest both his youth and his poverty.

His nickname refers to his penchant for painting Madonnas with a squirming or livelyChristChild, as in this painting.The Madonna sits on an ornate throne surrounded by angels, some in attitudes of worship, others playing musical instruments and singing. Christ sits on her lap, twisting his body in order to touch the lilies, a symbol of purity offered by an angel. In his left hand he holds a goldfinch, alluding to hisCrucifixion.Starnina's scene is rich in detail, color, and materials.Gold leafis used for the haloes, the trim of clothing and furniture, and the background. The gold of the Virgin's crown and the angel's garments and haloes are punchmarked to create lavish designs.

At the foot of the float are four different colored flags; whoever grabs the red flag first is the winning boatman.The view towards the Rialto bridge, seen in the far distance, shows in great detail the facades of buildings alongside the canal, with spectators filling the balconies.

        "description":"As the shadowy figure of Hercules observes from between two columns in the background, four wild horses rip apart the slender body of King Diomedes. The brown mare fastens her teeth on his arm, while another sinks her jaw into his leg. Bodies of the horses' previous victims lie piled to the right, above a pool of blood-stained water. This scene shows the dramatic climax from the eighth labor of Hercules, who was ordered to capture the four flesh-eating horses belonging to King Diomedes. Hercules killed the king in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them. Gustave Moreau's fascination with violent, emotionally charged subjects portrayed in jewel-like colors typifies mid-1800s French painting. Here Moreau's luminous and delicately applied watercolor washes enhance an already dramatic scene, highlighting the vertical body of the doomed Diomedes, whose extended, stretched limbs repeat the dynamic rearing motion of the brown horse's front legs. In calm contrast, Hercules rests in the background, silhouetted against a blue sky subtly rendered with light patches of wash.",

Using ropes, four men try to prepare a load to be taken onto the ship. Three men in broad-brimmed hats stand supervising on the left, while other sailors await the goods or attend to other vessels.Using brown ink, Willem van de Velde the Elder outlined the boats and gave definition to ropes and shipping tackle. In contrast, he used a blue-graywashto give volume and depth, using only a few simple strokes to suggest the folds of the sails. Building up the human figures by blending wash and ink, he made quick, sure lines that evoke each gesture and costume without many specific details. As the official artist for the Dutch fleet for many years, van de Velde often recorded such scenes of the bustling activity of marine life. Someone extensively incised the drawing for transfer, even down to the fine details, but no related copy is known today.",

Both groups of his views appealed to the traveler as well as the antiquarian.Seen through the central bay of the Arch of Constantine is the Colosseum, which Canaletto shifted to the left in the interests of compositional design. Figures converse, stroll, or carry out daily chores in the vicinity of these ancient buildings. To the left, a lone man sits on ruins with his back to the viewer, perhaps sketching or writing. Wealthy tourists and their servants laden with goods contrast with the poor Roman natives who have nothing, such as the woman who lies against the Arch or the man with a cane at the right.

        "description":"With a swirling cloud of pencil lines, Edgar Degas sketched the artist Ludovic Lepic seated in the front row of a theater. Degas merely suggested the backs of the seats, concentrating on his friend's relaxed position and focused gaze. Still wearing his long overcoat over his dinner jacket, Lepic has thrust his hands deep into his pockets and rests his feet on the edge of the stage in front of him, his sunken eyes fixed on the performance ahead.Concentrating first on producing a shrewdcaricatureof Lepic, Degas did not bother to erase surplus lines to create a neat image. Instead, he drew with increasing strength on top of his early strokes until he discovered a form he liked. For example, he redrew Lepic's left shoe several times as he experimented to find the correct angle. In contrast, Lepic's face was hastily but assuredly drawn and needed no corrections. Quick, hatched lines form the man's thinning hair and beard, and one stroke delineates both his rounded nose and eyebrow.",

        "description":"Asphinxholding a pomegranate branch, a bull, birds, and a man grasping the bull by one horn decorate this Mycenaean sieve jar. With its strainer spout, this jar would have been used for wine or any other liquid that might contain particles needing filtering.Most decoration on Mycenaean pottery consisted of extremely stylizedmotifsof marine or floral origin. Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus. Scholars are not certain whether Mycenaean pictorial pottery found on Cyprus was imported or made there, either by immigrant Mycenaean potters or by Cypriot potters under Mycenaean influence.",

The arrival of trains along the Arkansas River, which flows through Colorado and Kansas, also marked a shift in the region's economy. Barges and steamboats had previously controlled the movement of goods and passengers along the river, but the railroad's lower fares soon led to a new monopoly on transportation in the area. This photograph specifically illustrates a narrow section of the river that would have been difficult for large water vessels to navigate. Though laying tracks in this area was challenging, engineers devised structures, such as the short bridge in the distance, that overcame all obstacles.",

From a large tome held on his lap, he lifts a sheet of paper. Intending to declare the sitter's erudition, wealth, and status, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour placed de Rieux in his study, surrounded by fashionable and expensive objects. Behind him is a richly ornamental screen; on a table covered with blue velvet cloth are books, papers, and an inkstand with a quill pen. A globe stands next to the table and a Turkish carpet covers the floor. These objects identify the sitter as a connoisseur of fine and precious thing--like his father, whose considerable fortune de Rieux inherited the year this portrait was painted.This large, full-length portrait, still in its original, massive gilt frame, was assembled from separate sheets of paper laid on canvas and drawn entirely in pastel. The most sought-after portraitist of his day, La Tour worked exclusively in pastel, producing likenesses of the nobility and the wealthy middle class that were applauded for both their technical mastery and their astonishing verisimilitude.  In fact, one contemporary critic marveled that such a work as this portrait could be created using crayons.",

The dramatic lighting, which both illuminates and obscures his face, gives the portrait an emotional intensity. Carlyle was an intellectual hero to Cameron. Believing she had successfully captured him in a heroic posture, Cameron inscribed some prints of this image with the caption: \"Carlyle like a rough block of Michelangelo's sculpture.\" This powerful, head-on view reveals a strength and intensity of character that mirrors the straightforward, sometimes antagonistic discourses in his writing.",

In contrast, Chass\u00e9riau drew the boy's clothing with dark, strong lines, clearly emphasizing the precise, elegant hatching that creates the fabric's shadows and folds.",

Both are emblems of the chivalric Order of Santiago, Saint James the Greater.As an artist to several courts, Jan Gossaert traveled widely throughout Europe and became one of the first painters to disseminate the Italian Renaissance style in the Netherlands. In this painting, Gossaert combines psychological insight, keen observation of form, and a facility for imitating surface textures to create a portrait that is both imposing and believable.",

The vertical and horizontal two-by-fours convey a sense of strength, suggesting the solid security of a well built home. He probably made this image as an advertisement for a construction company.In the 1930s, the most practical way to create quality color photographs like this was by employing the carbro color process. This method is extremely labor intensive, requiring patience and precision. Outerbridge consistently and expertly employed this technique.

        "description":"For his portrait of Charles-Benjamin de Langes de Montmirail, the Baron de Lubi\u00e8res, Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard drew on both sides of a thin sheet of cream-colored paper. On the verso surface, the artist delicately applied red and black pastels to achieve richer and more subtle degrees of tone and relief on the finely detailed recto. This novel technique is found in several of Liotard's portraits of the period and derives from the tradition of toning miniatures on ivory on the verso.A wealthy and erudite amateur, the Baron de Lubi\u00e8res was part of the writer Voltaire's circle in Geneva and contributed several articles to Diderot'sEncyclop\u00e9die.Replete with fur muff, the fashionably attired sitter is clearly a gentleman of his time. Despite the attention to dress, Liotard depicted his sitter without adornment. The Baron de Lubi\u00e8res is in profile against a plain background with little depth. Nothing is allowed to overshadow the close likeness of the sitter achieved by Liotard. And it is this close likeness, above all else, that is intended to speak of the Baron de Lubi\u00e8res as a man of singular refinement and distinction.",

        "description":"Guercino drew caricatures for his own amusement and that of his friends. He filtered his acute observations of the people and events of everyday life through his sharp perception of the comic, a precedent established by his Bolognese predecessors the Carracci, and before them, Leonardo Da Vinci.Working quickly, Guercino caricatured two middle-aged men gazing intently to the left. He depicted their faces in the most detail, yet even here he used only a few, well-placed lines to suggest a jawline or a beard. He then delicately touched essential areas with luminous wash in varied intensities. In particular, the face of the man at far left shows Guercino's subtle accuracy with wash, suggesting the effects of sunlight on his skin. The men's clothing is treated even more subtly: a hasty criss-cross of tangled lines describe the arms of the man at the left, folded in his baggy sleeves.",

Dr. John Murray, who made this negative while working in India, altered it to improve the visual harmony and luminosity of the finished print. He achieved increased contrast by blocking out the sky area withpigmentand bleaching the deeply shaded section under the roof to more clearly show the mosque interior.The waxed-paper process was particularly useful for traveling photographers like Murray because the paper did not require immediate development. It also offered more translucency than other commonly used negatives. The process involved rubbing wax into the paper negative before it was sensitized and exposed. The wax created a smooth surface and reduced the blurring effects of paper fibers. Both the negative and the final print display great clarity of detail, as in the piercings of the surrounding wall and the outlines of distant buildings.",

The armor was probably made in southern Germany, but officers from Austria, Spain, and parts of Italy would have sought it out. Soldiers always wore their sword on the opposite side of its primary use; thus this man's rapier, hanging from his right side, demonstrates that he is left-handed.The artist may have adopted this three-quarter-length, three-quarter-view format from Titian, who introduced the composition in military portraits in the 1530s. As court painter to King Philip II of Spain, Mor painted many such portraits of members of the Spanish court and the Habsburg family.

        "description":"In this series of twenty drawings, Federico Zuccaro illustrated the early life of his older brother Taddeo Zuccaro, from the hardships of his early training in Rome until his first artistic triumph at the age of eighteen. In addition to the sixteen scenes from Taddeo's life, the series includes four drawings of allegorical Virtues flanking the Zuccaro emblem. The drawings vividly convey a sense of the artist's material and intellectual life in Renaissance Rome. Details of studio practice join depictions of precise locations, monuments, and antiquities and references to the great artistic personalities of the Renaissance, including Michelangelo and Raphael. Scholars believe that the shape of the drawings shows that they were studies for decorative ceiling panels. Because so many of the sheets contain images of Rome, they may have been intended for frescoes in the Palazzo Zuccari in Rome. In Federico's will of 1603, he left his palazzo to the Accademia di San Luca so that it could be used as a hostel for poor, young artists coming to study in the capital. The imagery of Taddeo's early struggles would have been an appropriate reminder for the students at the beginning of their careers.",

Rubens used a thin, fine line for the monumental figures of the apostles and cross-hatching to convey their solid forms.Theverso, or reverse side of the page, shows several studies of Medea and her slain children. According to Greek legend, Medea, a princess of the foreign kingdom of Colchis, was married to Jason, who eventually left her to marry a native Greek woman. A passionate and jealous woman, Medea stopped at nothing to obtain revenge, including murdering her own children. On the right, long, sweeping lines animate the figure of Medea, whose gaping mouth seems to emit anguished wails.

        "description":"Seeming to emerge from the background and float in front of it, the Trinity shown in this illumination has an assertive presence. Crivelli created a visually dynamic painting by contrasting the manner of representation in the main figural group with that of the background. In contrast to the sculptural clarity of the Trinity, the golden angels' heads in the background are painted in such a manner that they are partially formed out of the expanse of blue and red space, making them spatially ambiguous and ethereal. The Trinity represents the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to Catholic belief. The Trinity is shown here as God the Father holding the Crucified Christ with the dove representing the Holy Spirit between the two. This initial probably comes from a choir book that contained the sung portions of the Mass, where it introduced a text used on Trinity Sunday.",

Themarchandscould therefore offer their clients considerable choice over the final design. In 1785 Weisweiler became the main supplier of furniture mounted with S\u00e8vres plaques to the dealer Dominique Daguerre.On this work, the porcelain plaques were probably produced before the final position and form of the secr\u00e9taire had been determined. The two oval plaques on each side are painted to be viewed horizontally, but they are mounted vertically, with their groups of musical instruments tilted awkwardly on their sides. This orientation suggests that they were not originally intended to be mounted on the same piece of furniture as the three rectangular plaques set on the front.",

The next two scenes tell the story of the Judgment of Solomon. Two women come to Solomon carrying a dead baby and a living one, each claiming the living child as her own. When Solomon orders a soldier to cut the baby in two and give half to each, one woman gives up her claim rather than see the child killed. Solomon recognizes her as the true mother and returns the baby to her.In the last scene, three men claim to be a dead man's only true son. Solomon states that the legal heir will be able to shoot an arrow into the heart of the father's corpse, knowing that the real son will refuse.

Greeks made such offerings when praying for something to occur or in thanks for a good outcome. This scene may represent a youth asking for, or giving thanks for, a victory in one of the frequent musical contests in which well-bred Athenian young men competed.Although the depiction of a religious ritual on a cup used at a drinking party may seem odd today, the Greeks saw no conflict in this.

The man's heavenly aureole penetrates the surrounding shadows, rendered with tones of gray wash that intermingle with the white paper underneath.

The larger man turns his head away from the viewer, grasping the young boy's foot in his left hand, his right arm sensually wrapped around the boy's body. The boy sits splay-legged, leaning back against the man's arm with his face hidden in the forceful embrace of the man.Van Haarlem used modulated tones to suggest texture as revealed by gradations of light. Gleaming highlights reflect off the smooth, muscular bodies, showing off the dimpled texture of their flesh. Delicate white, almost frothy strokes form the leafy trees in the background.",

On a raised platform in front of it, three musicians play the fiddle and tambourine while townsfolk sit and listen. A covered carriage draws up to the scene, and a couple greets the new arrivals. In the center of the field, two other stalls provide shelter for those selling their wares.Van Goyen took full advantage of the diverse action to create a lively and entertainingcomposition. Peasant sellers and elegant and ordinary shoppers alike discuss and examine the varied goods for sale. Using fluid strokes, van Goyen suggested people's faces with circles and the outlines of buildings, animals, and foliage with rapid, vivid lines.Van Goyen frequently traveled about the Netherlands as a picture dealer, valuer, and speculator in tulip bulbs, land, and houses.

After conceiving of the composition of the fresco as a whole, he tried out individual figures. He may have used and reused aspects of the pose of this body for several of the fresco's figures.Biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Pontormo almost obsessively revised his ideas for this fresco; his many known drawings for the project attest to the search for perfection. In the foot and calf of this figure in particular, Pontormo approached the paper repeatedly, imparting almost nervous energy as he refined the lines. On the verso, the smooth outlines of the reclining figure skillfully match the relaxation and refinement of the pose itself.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace. Other craftsmen transferred this particular design into a terracotta model, and then local, less accomplished workers produced a more static stucco fountain for the central niche of the palace.",

        "description":"When Camille Silvy originally exhibited this photograph in 1859 (with the title Vall\u00e9e de l'Huisne), a reviewer wrote: \"It is impossible to compose with more artistry and taste than M. Silvy has done. The Vall\u00e9e de l'Huisne...[is a] true picture in which one does not know whether to admire more the profound sentiment of the composition or the perfection of the details.\"Early collodion-on-glass negatives, such as those Silvy used to render this scene, were particularly sensitive to blue light, making them unsuitable for simultaneously capturing definition in land and sky. Silvy achieved this combination of richly defined clouds and terrain by skillfully wedding two exposures and disguising any evidence of his intervention with delicate drawing and brushwork on the combination negative. The print exemplifies the tension between reality and artifice that is an integral part of the art of photography.The Huisne River provided power for flour and tanning mills and was significant in the history of Nogent-le-Rotrou, the town where Silvy was born. This photograph was taken from the Pont de Bois, a bridge over the river, looking toward the south and downstream. It was only a few minutes' walk from Silvy's birthplace. As the reviewer suggested, it is a sentimental image, an idyllic landscape full of reverence for and memory of a timeless place that was significant in the artist's development.",

In an effort to avoid breakage, the legs of the figure are only partially separated; the feet of this figure have broken off. Anatomical features such as arms are modeled three-dimensionally, whereas in later types, sculptors rendered this feature with incised lines.

At the top of the work, balancing on a thin black pin, fancifully cut forms interconnect to create a roughly circular shape. This circle includes the sculpture's one piece of recognizable imagery--an oversized pair of pliers.The myriad elements of Mark di Suvero's sculpture are sharp-edged and roughly formed. But viewed as a single object, the piece takes on an almost poetic wholeness. This unity is enhanced by the works kinetic properties. With the thick black beam serving as an essential counterbalance, many of the piece's surfaces can be set in gentle motion by the lightest touch or breeze. Despite variations in size and shape, the forms move in the same time and rhythm.\"Gandy dancer\" is a slang term for a railroad maintenance worker originating in the late 1800s. Gandy dancer crews were known for accompanying their laborious, repetitive work with singing and dancing. Although the connection between this abstract work and its title is elusive, the jagged steel of di Suvero's sculpture and its kinetic elements can be related to the rhythmic labor on the railroad.",

The dramatic, curvilinear contours suggest that the sculptor had a female form in mind.The sculptor Henry Moore always insisted that his work relate to recognizable forms, \"Purely abstract sculpture seems to me to be an activity that would be better fulfilled in another art such as architecture. . . . I have never been tempted to remain a purely abstract sculptor.\" This sculpture had its origins in a group of drawings created by the artist almost fifty years earlier. In the mid-1930s, Moore made a series of sketches based on carved wood figures from the South Pacific. Around 1940, he began to transform this imagery into three-dimensions, creating a series of helmet-encased heads.Bronze Formis directly related to this theme and was completed only a year before the artist's death.",

In the front, a couple and two children cross a footbridge to join the celebration, meeting another group as they depart. A line of wildly dancing laborers that snakes through the center of the drawing then leads the viewer's eye farther back. Small clusters of revelers fill the rest of the scene. Many toast the dancers, consuming their wine or beer straight from the barrel or from jugs. Vinckboons drew the landscape, figures, and buildings with a fine pen and brown ink while using darker areas of gray wash to add volume and depth to the buildings and water in the foreground. But the villagers interested Vinckboons more than the landscape. Their scurrying forms are the focus, while the dilapidated buildings and trees simply form a backdrop to their activities.",

This image illustrates a section called \"Pandaemonium,\" literally meaning \"all demons\" or hell.Teske made this photograph after years of experimentation with various forms of darkroom manipulation. It exemplifies his later style but also suggests Anger's multilayered, \"psychedelic\" approach to filmmaking.

        "description":"At first glance, there appears to be little of interest in this image. Two barely outlined chimneys rise ghostlike from what the title identifies as a rooftop. Looking again at the date of this image makes its significance clearer. Thisphotogenic drawingnegative was made around four years before the invention of photography was announced to the public, when William Henry Fox Talbot was still experimenting with light sensitive chemistry and optical devices.In this instance he used a camera obscura to project the light that was reflected off the building through a lens fitted onto the camera obscura. A piece of light-sensitive paper was taped at the back of the camera obscura. The reflection of the building was registered on the paper, which produced this sketchy negative image of the building. Talbot conducted these light-sensitivity experiments from mid-1834 until the summer of 1835. In early January 1839, he learned about Jacques Louis Mand\u00e9 Daguerre's impending announcement of hisdaguerreotypeprocess in France; two weeks after Daguerre's announcement, Talbot published his invention of the photogenic drawing.",

The manuscript's small scale suggests that a layperson used this book to follow along with the masses, and it was likely once part of a larger devotional text, probably a book of hours.Most of the mass texts begin with an image depicting the event from Christ's life or the saint that the feast celebrates. Many of the manuscript's miniatures were painted by the Pseudo-Jacquemart de Hesdin, who most likely worked at the court of Jean, duc de Berry from around 1380 until about 1410.

In the 500s B.C., Greek vase-painters frequently placed eyes on vessels, perhaps because they were believed to be apotropaic--that is, they had the power to ward off evil. The other side of the cup has a similar scene with three busts, one male and two female. The center female was once painted white and wears a type of headdress called apolos, typical of Greek goddesses. These busts, however, are harder to identify than those on the front of the cup. Some scholars identify them as Zeus, Hebe, and Hera, suggesting that the subject of the cup as a whole would be the apotheosis of Herakles, his introduction on Mount Olympus as a god. Other scholars, however, interpret the heads as Hades, Persephone, and Demeter and the cup's theme as Herakles' introduction into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult that promised a better afterlife to its followers.",

A multitude of hounds rest in the shadows; and the prize of the hunt, a deer, lies in the right foreground. Two huntsmen converse with a hostess-- perhaps regaling her with tales from the day's chase. On the balcony above, a washerwoman sets out laundry. At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s. In this painting, the pose of the man in blue, seen from the rear, quotes a well-known ancient sculpture of Hercules. Berchem may have seen this sculpture in person or copied it after an engraving.",

The king insisted that Bel was a living god and pointed to the offerings of food and wine that Bel consumed every night. Cautiously, Daniel noted that bronze statues do not eat. Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing. By contrast, the youthful Daniel seems small, and his posture suggests modesty or submissiveness before his ruler. Rembrandt evoked the exotic mystery of a pagan cult by showing only part of the monumental idol emerging from the flickering lamplight on the right.

        "description":"Although the Venetians tried to protect their monopoly of colorlesscristallo(crystal) glass, issuing orders and threatening terrible punishments to workers who emigrated to the North, the manufacture of this glass spread to many parts of Europe in the 1500s. Consumers from all over Europe coveted the colorlesscristallo,as it reproduced the brilliance and clarity of preciousrock crystal. In 1534 in Hall, Austria,Emperor Ferdinand Iopened one of the earliest manufactoriesproducingfa\u00e7on de Veniseglass in northern Europe. Wolfgang Vitl ran the workshop, employing both Venetian glassblowers and local craftsmen.Vitl and his successor Sebastian H\u00f6chstetter produced vessels that areItalianatein shape but larger and sturdier than genuine Venetian products. This goblet's flat foot and hollow stem imitate vessels produced in Murano fifty years earlier. But its body, molded in a pattern of drop-shaped protrusions painted in gold, white, and green, depends more on Germanic influences. Only traces of the paint remain, making it now impossible to guess the original design in gold or even to know how much of the goblet was covered.",

        "description":"Asatyrholding a drinking cup decorates the interior of this Athenian red-figure cup.  Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature. This varied intensity of line enabled the artist to give a sense of mass and three-dimensionality to the satyr.",

In 1839 Talbot made public his process for fixing images on paper treated with silver chloride. He fixed his original images, however, with a salt that did not actually remove the silver chloride, leaving the image unstable and still sensitive to light. In 1841, the year this picture was taken, he began printing more stable images by using a fixing agent called \"hypo,\" which thoroughly removed the silver chloride. Although the fuzziness of Talbot's first prints made his images in some ways less pleasing than the exactness of a daguerreotype, the process did allow multiple positive images to be created from a single negative. In this regard, Talbot's discoveries represent the origin of modern photography.",

Carre\u00f1o made this preparatory drawing for his paintingThe Baptism of Christ, which shows John the Baptist anointing Jesus in the desert as God watches from above.To add solidity to the chest and limbs, Carre\u00f1o used stumping, a technique of blending charcoal and chalk with a soft, stick like object. Thick, charcoal-black lines delineate rippling muscles and slightly enlarged limbs. White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carre\u00f1o's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists. Carre\u00f1o studied the works of Titian, and often collaborated with other Spanish artists captivated by the Italian style, such as fellow court painter Francisco Rizi.",

        "description":"In this stark, poignant drawing, Henri Lehmann concentrated on capturing the dramatic emotions of the mourners grieving over Christ's death. The immediate focus of attention, theVirgin Maryswoons in a faint at the foot of the cross, surrounded byJoseph of Arimathea, Mary Magdalene, and several other women. The drapery swirling around the cross and the various gestures and expressions of grief emphasize the scene's pathos. The tip of a spear, the crown of thorns, and four nails on the ground beneath the Virgin's hands signify the implements of Christ's suffering.Lehmann's strong verticalcomposition, with figures wrapped around the foot of the central cross, anchors the scene. In sharp contrast to the dark graywashon the other figures, he used large amounts of white chalk highlighting on and around the Virgin's face. He made this study as one of the last stages in his preparation for a painting in a Paris chapel.",

He towers ominously above eye level, taking up most of the picture frame. Like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's heroic character in the play,Faust, photographer Edmund Teske himself was a gifted alchemist. His darkroom experiments sometimes led to brilliant discoveries, as it did with this image.The print's partially reversed tones, especially visible in the subject's robe and beard, resulted from Teske's accidentalsolarizationof the negative. This effect heightens the moment's drama, emphasizing the low, frontal stage lighting, which casts eerie shadows on Mephisto's pallid face. As Teske developed the 8-by-10-inch negatives he had exposed during the theater production, he accidentally flashed this one with light.Teske had always admired Man Ray's solarized photographs but could not find out how they were made. After his own fortuitous discovery of solarization, Teske quickly gained control of the technique and continued using it throughout his career as a means to heighten creative expression.",

The artist drew more broadly on the verso, using considerable black chalk underdrawing along with the brown ink. Here the Virgin and Child sit in profile on an elaborate throne ornamented with a sphinx, a curling rinceaux motif, and various floral designs. Given the profile format, scholars believe this sheet was probably intended as a study for a relief, perhaps in terracotta.

The eyes of the two children meet as Mary looks on. The doves that the Christ Child gives to his cousin are an allusion to both Jesus's future role as the King of Peace as well as his eventual sacrifice. Joseph enters through a doorway in the background.Although using oil, Reni applied his color with the broad brushwork of fresco painting. He outlined important details with dark, jagged strokes. It was once thought that the sketchy appearance of Reni's late works meant that they were unfinished, but like many aging artists, Reni pared form and color to the bare essentials for purely expressive purposes.Lost for centuries, this painting reappeared in the possession of a family in Michigan who sold it to the Getty Museum in 1984.",

Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, grasps his left hand urging him toward virtuous restraint. The god of wine, Bacchus, pours wine onto the young man to arouse his desires. Cupid, the tiny child-god of love, directs the youth's face toward his mother Venus who presses her right breast, emblematic of sybaritic pleasures.The entire surface of the vessel is carved and showcases the technical virtuosity of its maker, Balthasar Griessmann. This ivory specialist skillfully moved between different degrees of relief: from figures fully sculpted in three-dimensions to extremely shallow passages. Floral Bacchic motifs cover the lid, base, and stem of the vessel. Putti bearing fruit-laden garlands cavort around the lid, which is surmounted at the pinnacle with a single putto brandishing a cup in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. At the base lie recumbent drunken putti and satyrs.Griessmann faithfully derived the goblet's composition from a work by Otto van Veen,Allegory of the Temptations of Youth, known to the carver from a print by Antwerp artist Pieter Perret. Griessmann cunningly puts the allegory in the hands of the imbiber, who--like the youth--should consider the balance of indulgence with moderation. The virtuosity of the piece is such that it was most likely displayed at courtly banquets--a showpiece, to be viewed and admired, rather than utilized.",

The woman holds a basket filled with standard funerary offerings: ribbons, wreaths, andaryballoi, a type of small oil vessel. The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.",

In the 1600s, men and women wore their hats indoors and even at dinner; only in the presence of royalty was headgear removed.Working with great sureness, Govaert Flinck nearly completed a finished drawing except for the positioning of the cane, which he left uncertain. Using only black and white chalk against colored paper, he created a dynamic composition out of a single figure. The black chalk strokes outline the body and clothing, while the light chalk lines highlight the shimmering movement of the silk overcoat. These white tones appear to advance to the front, while the blue of the paper recedes into space. Although Flinck sometimes used his figure studies for paintings, he does not seem to have done so with this drawing.",

While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor, his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam watches the scene closely from a doorway on the right. Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas draws the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the \u00c9cole Militaire.

There is an element of fear in these photographs, juxtaposed with beauty.--Jo Ann CallisComparing the artist's earliest work with the subject of the nude, the \"Morphe\" series consists of black-and-white studies staged with a model partially submerged in water. In this image, the composition incorporates a floating, floral-patterned cloth and plant reflections on the water. Depending on the attitude of the viewer, the human model in these dark images might express death or dreaming.",

        "description":"The Virgin Mary and Joseph watch with clasped hands as a priest prepares to circumcise their son, the infant Jesus. The drawing's simplified linear style appropriately renders their air of homespun piety. Sebald Beham relied upon simple, bold outlines and hatching to describe the scene, since few details would be visible once the scene was set high in a church window.During the 1520s, Beham and his workshop produced many designs for stained-glass windows. This highly finished sketch was part of a series of more than twenty-five works made for a group of windows showing scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ. The drawing functioned as a cartoon for a specialist stained-glass maker, who then cut and painted the glass in shapes and colors according to the design. The color notations and red chalk lines inscribed throughout the drawing indicate the placement of glass sections and leading. The lead was then soldered and cemented around the glass pieces before the panels were secured to the window's iron cross-bars.",

Very pleased, the pope ordered another version for his collection, this one to be painted on stone. Sebastiano had begun painting on stone around 1530 and had come to favor it for some important commissions because stone lasted longer than canvas or wood.

Van Dyck made this portrait as a study for a print that was part of a series known asThe Iconography. This series was a collection of portraits of distinguished artists, soldiers, statesmen, administrators, and scholars of the early 1600s.Using only black chalk, Van Dyck created a striking characterization of his old teacher. By placing Van Balen's right hand on the head of an antique bust while his left presses a soft cloth close to his chest, Van Dyck effectively suggested the erudition and refined personality of his mentor.",

The side loops above the horned masks on the sides and the holes cut from either side of the base would never have been used to suspend the Museum's flask; they were retained as decoration and a reminder of the vessel's earlier function.Marine scenes decorate both sides of the flask: one of a triton abducting a nereid and one of two fighting tritons. This exceptionally rich and varied palette is typical of ceramics from the Fontana workshop.

He cut sheets of butcher-block paper using a razor blade, transforming them into abstract patterns. But these incisions were anything but random; his creations were often inspired by images he found in the hundreds of books he kept on shelves in his workshop. Hanging his paper creations from clips a few feet in front of a wall, he carefully lit them--the shapes, light, and shadow providing a sense of depth and kinetic energy.The inspiration for this piece is the legend of the Three Graces, fertility goddesses from Greek mythology. Light penetrates the slits, suggesting three bodies dancing together.

Georges Trubert depicted the jewel-encrusted frame as a three-dimensional object casting a shadow on the page, while the chain from which it hangs runs through two slits seemingly cut into the surface of the page, an outstanding example of trompe-l'oeil.The bush that burned but was not consumed, which Moses encountered while on Mount Sinai, appears below the image of the Virgin crowned as Queen of Heaven. Medieval theologians likened the bush to Mary's virginity, which remained intact after the conception of Christ. The flames spreading from the flowering bush form a decorative, rhythmic border for the entire page.",

        "description":"The esteemed Flemish artist Simon Bening lavishly illuminated this prayer book for the powerful Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Elector and Archbishop of Mainz and an ambitious patron of the arts. Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.",

She stands with her right hand modestly covering her pubic area while her left hand drops her garment on a vase. Her eyes were originally inlaid in a contrasting material, and she would have worn earrings.This Roman statuette copies on a smaller scale one of the most famous Greek statues ever made. About 350 B.C. the Greek sculptor Praxiteles carved a cult statue of the goddessAphrodite, the first full-scale female nude in Greek art. Praxiteles' statue became extremely popular, especially in theHellenisticand Roman periods, capturing the attention of both writers and artists. Although the original statue does not survive, its popularity led to a huge production of copies and variations on the theme, so that today more nude Aphrodites survive than any other single ancient statue type.The idea of the goddess caught in a private moment follows a certain voyeuristic tradition in Hellenistic art, and part of the statue's appeal was clearly erotic. The gesture of the goddess's right hand is ambiguous, drawing attention to her pubis and concealing it at the same time. Roman writers such asPlinydid not hesitate to point out the overtly sexual reaction that Praxiteles' statue produced in viewers.",

Much of Mexico's rural population began moving to the capital around the time that Alvarez Bravo made this image. Their hardship and the disparity between the social classes became highly visible among Mexico's citizens, and in Alvarez Bravo's work.Alvarez Bravo used visual clues to illustrate the couple's social plight. By relegating the figures to the extreme lower foreground and filling the remainder of the composition with tree trunks and branches, Alvarez Bravo illustrated their lowly status. To symbolize the almost impossible task of improving one's circumstances, he cropped the couple's feet out of the photograph. At the same time, a beam of light falls across the left side of the image and onto the woman's figure, as if to signal that a better future may be forthcoming.",

Here, Jan Steen depicted her as a temptress, rather than the innocent victim of the king's passion. In this moralizing painting, Steen commented on the foolishness of human behavior.Bathsheba's robe is casually arranged to reveal her breast and bare legs. The shoe in the right foreground symbolizes lasciviousness; the fountain on the left probably alludes to female fecundity. She is so lost in her thoughts that she holds King David's note loosely in her right hand and pays no attention to the small dog or to the old woman grasping her shoulder.",

So shaken was his mind, and with the imagination he had, he really believed these to be what they seemed to be. He began his search for the stones that seemed better and more beautiful; he filled a sack, in which he carried his small things and his drawings.\" In a continuous narrative, Federico represented his brother four times. Taddeo falls asleep by a stream on the left and dreams in a circle above his head. In his illness he awakens to a hallucination that the river stones are painted with figures by Polidoro.

A popular, influential professor and lecturer and later a reforming government minister, the distinguished philosopher must be considered one of Le Gray's most eminent sitters.Cousin was well into his sixties when this photograph was made, and his somewhat disheveled appearance advertises his status as an elderly bachelor. His clothing is wrinkled, and patterned fabric untidily extrudes between his vest and trousers. The hand tucked dramatically into his vest hides the lens of his monocle, with the cord barely visible underneath. Through retouching the negative, Le Gray tried to simplify Cousin's silhouette by eliminating the back of the chair on which he sat; its traces remain, however, interrupting the otherwise smooth line of the right shoulder.",

        "description":"\"Love will prevail as long as there is music and merrymaking,\" wrote Dutch poet Jacob Cats in the 1600s; this painting exemplifies Cats's slogan. As the elegantly dressed woman plays the lute, a man, who may be her instructor, keeps rhythm and time with his hand. The foot warmer in the lower left corner symbolizes love, and the bed suggests an amorous relationship between the man and woman, maybe even seduction.Gerard ter Borch always set a mood, creating a subtle psychological interplay between the people in his intimate paintings. He delighted in meticulously describing and contrasting varied textures: the soft pile of the woman's velvet jacket, distinguished from its plump white fur trim; the shimmer of her pearl-colored satin dress; the dog's soft, wavy fur; and the variations of wood grain in the cello, furniture, and floor. He noticed even the most minute details, such as the nails in the floorboards and the brass door handle. Ter Borch created about eleven paintings of female lute players, often repeating themotifsof the woman in the satin gown and fur-trimmed jacket, the dog, the foot warmer, the four-poster bed in the background, and the partially opened door.",

Baldassare Peruzzi drew the figures so that the viewer seems to be looking up at them, while they in turn look back down at the viewer.Deftly handling the point of the quill, Peruzzi indicated both the lighting and the volume of the forms with a delicate network of hatching and cross-hatching. Numerous lines suggest the wavy strands of Joseph's hair and beard, the Madonna's long, flowing robes, and her strong legs beneath the folds of fabric.A grid in black chalk has been drawn over the figures of the Virgin and Child in order to simplify copying the drawing onto another surface.",

        "description":"Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn made twenty-five \"Indian drawings,\" based on miniatures from the Mughal Empire that he saw in a Dutch collection and presumably studied over a long period. Adopting some aspects of the extremely precise manner of these miniatures--so unlike his usual loose, evocative style of draftsmanship--Rembrandt nonetheless enlivened the figures' poses by giving them more sense of action than did the Mughal style. Despite their looseness, his lines present the figures in the three-quarter body and profile head view common in Indian painting.A contemporary of Rembrandt known for his building campaigns and as a patron of art, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is recognizable from his characteristic dress and face--and the aureole, which distinguished portrayals of Mughal rulers beginning with his father's reign. This depiction resembles the many portraits in the illustrated history that Shah Jahan commissioned of his reign. In characteristic Mughal fashion, he rather stiffly faces his eldest and most beloved son, Dara Shikoh. The falcon represents the popular courtly sport of hunting, often depicted in Mughal art.",

        "description":"In this sculpture, painting's basic building block, the brushstroke, has been playfully transformed into an oversized, three-dimensional form. Made from aluminum, three vertical \"strokes\" of pure color are frozen in space and rise to a height of more than ten feet. One edge of the yellow brushstroke cuts through the dominant stroke of black and blue; the yellow also curves into a diminutive stroke of red paint.Each brushstroke is a fully realized three-dimensional form that, somewhat implausibly, allows the viewer to experience a stroke of paint from different vantage points. The sculpture humorously reminds us that paint is literally three-dimensional.Roy Lichtenstein first explored brushstrokes as a subject in a series of paintings initiated in 1965. As with many of his works, he used a comic book source--a panel of an artist at work fromStrange Suspense Stories--as the basis for his brushstrokes. The subject became one of the artist's most recognizable images and he would return regularly to the brushstrokemotiffor more than thirty years. In the early 1980s, Lichtenstein began creating sculptural brushstrokes.",

The day: a late afternoon within the last decades of the 1700s.This painting is one in a series of cloud studies--in fact the 48th--that Simon Denis made to hone his observational and painting skills. Denis' confident paint handling and sensitive rendering of light capture the awe-inspiring power of nature. Using a warm palette, he juxtaposed light and dark tones to imply both the clouds' airy buoyancy and moisture-laden heaviness. Lively brushstrokes convey the constantly shifting forces of wind and light.This dramatic cloudscape predates by a century the Impressionists' celebration of outdoor landscape painting in which they recorded specific, yet fleeting, effects of weather and time and exhibited those results as finished paintings. But in Denis' time, oil sketching on paper while outdoors offered the artist an opportunity to test and sharpen his skills. Denis would have kept his cloud studies in the studio for future reference for his finished paintings.",

He also made extensive use of bodycolor, applying this opaque mixture thickly and loosely, particularly in the foreground. His gentlebackgroundblue and smokychiaroscuroeffects evoke the atmosphere of a bright but hazy day.In this extremely rare colored landscape drawing, Koninck achieved the expansive space and rich atmosphere of his panoramic landscape paintings.

Thus his hand takes the place of his face and becomes a symbol of himself.Samaras repeatedly focused attention on himself in his Photo-Transformations series. He often extensively altered these Polaroid self-portraits by manipulating the surface emulsions while they were fresh from the camera and still malleable.",

The lack of accessories, the geometric simplicity of the shapes, and theclassicizingsquare form of the bust give the work an otherworldly effect. To augment this effect, the artist carved the face with smooth planes, left the pupils blank and unincised, and fashioned the large loops of hair on the top of her head in simple, clear shapes to bring out the figure's abstract qualities.The figure's remoteclassicismis leavened by thenaturalismof details such as her bumpy nose. Pierre-Jean David d'Angers captured the awkwardness of adolescence in his sitter, representing Mary Robinson as a shy teenager with her head demurely tilted forward and down, casting a deep shadow below her brows.Mary Robinson was the daughter of a merchant and sea captain with a route between New York and Le Havre, France.

        "description":"The story ofDon Quixote, based on the highly popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, served as the basis for one of the Gobelins manufactory's most popular sets of tapestries, woven in nine separate series throughout the 1700s. Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts. On August 20, 1786,Louis XVIpresented the Museum's tapestries to his sister-in-law, the duchess of Saxe-Teschen, and her husband the duke, the governors of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques. The tapestries were woven in Michel Audran's workshop, assisted by his son, Jean Audran, fils.",

He called his drawings of trees \"portraits\" and the trees themselves \"beings.\" His rendering of a pathway winding through an old forest demonstrates this affinity for natural entities. Zigzags of chalk and a line of trees give the hillside a rugged character, defining a downhill slope from the left side of the drawing to the lower right corner. There, Rousseau incorporated aserpentinecreek with curved lines along the right side, leading to a distant, small town with a church. At the far left of the drawing, a person stands on the pathway, providing a sense of scale and distance.The artists of theBarbizon Schoolwere among the first to paint and drawenplein air, taking their tools outdoors to create their works of art, rather than inventing a scene from memory in a studio. In keeping with the Barbizon School's techniques, Rousseau captured the essence of the trees, giving them body and form, but rendered details such as leaves minimally with short strokes of chalk. The one gnarled, old tree at left that receives special attention becomes the focus of the image.On the verso, Rousseau used graphite to sketch trees surrounding a cottage. As in the recto, the trees are drawn with few particulars, emphasizing their shape over other details.",

        "description":"The bodies of four dead coyotes dry and bleach in the Arizona sun. Tufts of fur poke out beneath the remains of tails, and ribs clearly show through stretched and drying sinew. In this scene, Frederick Sommer'scompositioncelebrates life by contrasting it with its final process--death. The bones and fur stand out as lighter shades against the darkness of the soil beneath, brightening the otherwise dull terrain. Sommer's dynamic composition and framing brings the photograph to life. The coyote on the left side appears to be leaping out of the picture, while another one enters the image from below. In the center, one coyote lies in a suckling position under another. The legs of all the coyotes seem to be captured in mid-motion, adding a sense of action to the image.Sommer used a large-format camera to capture this degree of detail. This photograph was part of a series of images of dead-animal parts that Sommer took between 1938 and 1948.",

In concert they present his limp, lifeless form to the viewer as an object for veneration. Despairing angels in the borders grieve over Christ's death.The artist's inclusion ofnaturalisticeffects counters the artifice of the theatricalcomposition. He enveloped the figures in voluminous draperies that fall to the ground in heavy folds suggesting bodymass.

In a clear case of ineptitude, the ship named Medusa foundered in the sea off the coast of Africa in 1816. A raft with 140 passengers drifted for thirteen days before being rescued; only fifteen people survived. In preparation for his disturbing and controversial painting of the incident, G\u00e9ricault made many studies from life, like this one, to achieve a sense of realism and specificity.The sitter wears a shirt similar to those worn by the survivors of theMedusa. G\u00e9ricault captured the man's character with great sympathy and spontaneity; his watery eyes do not focus on anything outside the canvas but appear to express an internal torment. Shades of brown, gray, and beige blend together to imitate his dark complexion. Dabs of white and beige paint are used to indicate reflective light in his eyes and on the tip of his nose, his bottom lip, and his chin.",

Herakles, identified by his lionskin, sits astride Triton, who writhes away from the hero, trying to break his grip. The figures are so closely intertwined that it is difficult to tell them apart. The battle of Herakles and Triton first appeared in Greek art about 565 B.C. and was especially popular in the period from about 530 to 510 B.C. No ancient author recorded the story of Herakles and Triton. This lack of literary sources for the depiction and the fact that it appears almost exclusively in Athenian art has led some scholars to look for a special meaning in the scene. The mythological battle may have had symbolic political significance for the Athenians. The tyrants who ruled Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, may have adopted Herakles as their symbol; and the scene may refer to a naval victory of Athens over her neighboring enemy, the city-state of Megara.",

Like most photographers of the time, she struggled with the mechanical operation of the camera and the chemistry involved to create an image.In the 1860s, photographers were required to work rapidly because all of the chemicals had to be used while they were still fresh. They had to compose the subject for the photograph, hoping the sitter could maintain his or her pose long enough for them to make the exposure. The complexity and urgency of the process led to many technical mistakes, and Cameron's early attempts were no exception. Even though the sitter's face is slightly out of focus, and streaks from the application of the chemistry are evident, it was with great pride and satisfaction that Cameron declared this portrait of tousle-haired Annie Philpot to be the first completed print that she considered successful.",

Several more poplars stand at the right, more shadowy still. Clearly visible through the Cont\u00e9 crayon rubbing, the watermarkMICHALLETemphasizes the paper's surface. This nearly abstract drawing, with its complete lack of edges among the forms, is a study in the pure interaction of light and shadow.When Seurat returned to Paris in 1880, he spent two years drawing in only black and white. This choice allowed him to explore the phenomenon of light's interpenetration and reflection. While absorbed in his preoccupation with gradation and contrast rather than line, he soon mastered the balance of massing light and dark. He developed a unique method of rubbing Cont\u00e9 crayon across highly textured paper, which gave him a variety of tones according to the degree of pressure he applied.",

Teske and Evans both appreciated the snapshot aesthetic and the informal poses of passengers absorbed in their activities.",

        "description":"In reality his head is a calculator, his arms respectively a pencil and a pen stand, his legs two rulers, and his body a ledger . . .Written in 1923, this disparaging quote evinces one author's view of institutional staff members such as the savings bank cashier in this portrait. The emergence of a white-collar workforce in Germany during the 1920s vastly expanded opportunities for such new types of salaried employees as the bookkeeper, the bureaucrat, the secretary. Although rising employment rates were a positive development, Germany's volatile financial market during this period often meant that jobs were insecure.August Sander intended this image of a stern bank clerk to be part of his portfolio entitled \"The Official.\" The monumental cash register and the note in his hand inform the viewer of this man's monotonous role. Interestingly, only a few years before this picture was made, the value of German currency was so low that many people preferred to trade their Deutschmarks for American dollars, rather than to deposit them in a bank.",

He is not looking at the tarmac and runways below him but at his wife and child nearby. The photographer, Garry Winogrand, also captures the mother, teetering in her high heels, as she playfully interacts with her daughter. Winogrand captured the couple's other children, too, as they disregard a \"keep off the fence\" sign in order to see the plane below.Winogrand apparently disliked air travel, but loved photographing in airports. He lingered there himself to watch how passengers and visitors spent time as they waited for their flights. Although Winogrand sought out certain places, his images are really about the people who, however briefly, inhabit them.

A cropped version of it with a single eye also appears as the first plate in a 1934 book of his photographs.Like the emotive expression of a silent screen star in a film still, the woman's plaintive upward glance and mascara-encrusted lashes seem intended to invoke wonder at the cause of her distress. The face, however, belongs not to a real woman but to a fashion mannequin who cries tears of glistening, round glass beads; the effect is to aestheticize the sentiment her tears would normally express. Man Ray made this photograph in Paris around the time of his breakup with his lover Lee Miller, and the woman's false tears may relate to that event in the artist's life.",

According to legend, angels accompanied him as he carried his own head from the place of execution to his chosen burial site, where later the church of Saint Denis was built just outside of Paris. Dressed in his bishop's garments, the saint is depicted with two haloes--one behind his decapitated head and a second behind the stump of his neck. This feature reflects medieval notions about the incorruptibility of saintly remains--the body does not decompose after death.By including two haloes, the artist emphasizes Saint Denis's presence in each part of his body and the sanctity of his physical remains.",

        "description":"I have just finished a severed kanak [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention.--Paul GauguinWriting to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words \"Arii\" and \"Matamoe\" in the canvas' upper left. The first means \"noble;\" the second, \"sleeping eyes,\" a phrase that implies \"death.\"The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic \"primitivism.\" In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a \"primitive\" culture.",

His keen interest in anatomy was a typical manifestation of the emphasis that theRenaissanceplaced on the study of the human form.Beham also varied the level of finish on each skull. He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness. The drawing appears to have been a preparatory sketch for a print.On the other side of the sheet, Beham freely sketched an architectural study showing the top portion of a facade. Scholars are uncertain whether this was simply a fantasy building or a structure to be used for a specific festival.",

        "description":"Although Saint Sebastian is usually depicted bound to a tree or pillar and pierced by arrows, that attempt by the Romans to take his life was unsuccessful. Ludovico Carracci chose to represent the moment after the subsequent deadly beating, when Roman soldiers dumped Sebastian's limp and lifeless body into a sewer.Against the dark of night, brutish soldiers lift and tug the dead saint's body. Ludovico contrasted the tensile strength of their straining bodies with the slackness of the saint's limbs, head, and facial muscles as he falls into the sewer's depths. The night atmosphere is dark and thick: figures seem to emerge from the blackness. Light glints dully off helmets and armor, but the soldiers' faces are unreadable. A bright light suffuses the body of Saint Sebastian, making him the focal point of the composition.In 1612 Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned this painting from Ludovico for his family's chapel in the Church of San Andrea della Valle in Rome. The chapel commemorated the site where Saint Sebastian's body was recovered from the sewer, called the Cloaca Maxima. Barberini decided to keep the painting in his private collection, believing that an image of the recovery of Sebastian's body by Christians was more appropriate for the church.",

        "description":"Between 1648 and 1652, Herman Saftleven the Younger concentrated on drawing imaginary mountain landscapes featuring large, prominent rock formations and distant views that dominate small figures. Although in this drawing he has created a natural-looking scene, many of his drawings are not topographical and he often used interchangeablemotifs. These fantastic, vaguely Central European views reflect the influence of Roelandt Savery's rugged, fictitious mountain landscapes, such as Savery'sLandscape with Waterfall, created about thirty years earlier than Saftleven's drawing.At a time when travel was difficult, landscape drawings and prints gave people both a means and an excuse to conjure up exotic, far-flung lands. More than 1,200 of Saftleven's topographical and imaginary landscape drawings survive, most of which are finished, large-scale drawings made for collectors.",

The many religious emblems, such as achalice, cross,crozier, stole,miter, papal tiara, and keys of office were appropriate to this fireplace design because, as a member of the Braschi family, Pope Pius VI called this palace home.The loose handling of details apparent in the plumed helmet, the lion's face, and the military shields indicate that this was a preliminary sculptural sketch known as abozzetto.A nineteenth-century photograph shows the now-lost fireplace as it was eventually built, with green-and-white marble andgiltbronze emblems of the Braschi family.",

Edges of objects run into each other; for example, a black arabesque seemingly escapes from the blue cloth to capture an apple in the center; the sinuous curves of the blue ginger pot's rattan straps merge with other straps on the body of the bottle behind. Giving form and mass to objects through the juxtaposition of brushstrokes and carefully balanced colors and textures, he gave the painting a sense of comforting stability.",

Castiglione \"drew\" with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting. He used white sparingly to highlight; most of the composition is sketched in thick, textural strokes of red-brown oil paint, enhancing the image's tone of dark, brooding emotion. Flatly painted areas of blue set off the figures from the background.",

        "description":"In the crook of her right arm, Madame Moitessier supports a loose, lacy shawl that twines around her. Her brooch attracts attention while the tiny necklace nearly disappears. In Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's later painting, a smaller brooch seems insignificant, while a long string of pearls echoes the flowing sweep of the woman's shawl and provides a purpose for the hand at her waist. He made two additional studies of her left hand in the upper right corner, exploring how she might hold the shawl.In this preparatory study for an 1851 painting, Ingres concentrated on the woman's dress, her jewels, and the positions of her arms and hands. To determine the figure's proportions, he drew a grid or \"squared\" the drawing. He freely worked out new ideas from the bodice on down, probably tracing the head and shoulders from another study. Ingres made many such preparatory sketches for his four painted portraits of In\u00e8s Moitessier, a banker's wife from a prominent family of government officials.",

The picture's nacreous palette and shimmering light effects exemplify Turner at his most accomplished.When first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with its pendant,Ancient Rome; Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus,the painting was accompanied by a modified quotation from Lord Byron's masterpiece,Childe Harold's Pilgrimage(1818): \"The moon is up, and yet it is not night, \/ The sun as yet divides the day with her.\" Like the poem, Turner's painting evokes the enduring sublimity of Rome, which had been for artists throughout history less a place in the real world than one in the imagination.The painting is in a remarkable state of preservation and remains untouched since it left Turner's hands.",

The larger house's monumentality and detail contrasts with the cursory jottings that compose the neighboring house and the few squiggly lines that indicate the earth.As always, Rembrandt drew only what was essential. His animated line moved vigorously across the sheet, creating rich and varied effects of texture and surface. At this point in his career, Rembrandt delighted in exploring the visual impact of varied, dense lines, as seen in the moss growing in the thatched roof of the nearest house.

The panel on the shoulder of this Athenianred-figurekalpis, however, shows a group of youths in a moment of relaxation. Accompanied by their dogs, the youths are conversing, either leaning on walking sticks or sitting, while one leans forward to tie his sandal.The kalpis was a new vase shape in the early 400s B.C. The rounded profile replaced the older, more angular form ofhydria, or water jar. Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis. Other features, such as the depiction of a scene from everyday life and the type of ornament framing the panel, also suggest that this vase comes from the later phase of the Kleophrades Painter's career.",

The main drama unfolds before a magnificent temple housing a statue of Jupiter. Below, the priest and followers converge upon an ornately carved altar with sacrificial animals. On the right, Paul strides towards the crowd with an anguished expression on his face as he tears his robe, while Barnabas throws up his arms in frustration. The vignettes in the upper left and right corners show two other scenes from Paul's life, being stoned and dragged outside the city and healing a man who had never walked.Coecke produced the drawing as a cartoon for one of nine tapestries on the life of Saint Paul. The intricate design of this jewel-like drawing contrasts with the monumental scale of the final tapestry.",

The arms were engraved in England late in the 1700s, effacing the heraldry of their original owner, a Portuguese archbishop. The cross of the Portuguese Order of Christ and the tassels of the archbishop's hat are still visible. They were left in place by an English silversmith who was probably unaware of their meaning.",

Although Steichen was still active as a painter when he made the photograph, the image also implies that the photographer's craft is equal to that of the traditional artist.Using a gum bichromate process served to heighten the painterly effect of this photograph, creating a soft-focus, grainy image that did not resemble the sharp-focus prints that were more popularly favored. The overall darkness of the print heightens the picture's drama, while the contrasting highlight areas of shirt collar and brush tip create a tonal balance within the composition.

The cup itself has a distinctive form with a deep bowl, a large foot with a tall, concave profile, and a thick ring joining the foot and the bowl. Scholars refer to cups with this combination of form and decoration as Chalkidian cups. The strikingly angular form of the foot has led some scholars to believe that the shape of the cup may have been derived from metal prototypes. Eyes decorate the exterior of all Chalkidian cups. In Greek thought, large, staring eyes had an apotropaic power, that is, they had the ability to ward off evil and danger. The painted eyes on this cup may have protected the drinker, or the frontal face may have represented an abbreviated mask connected withDionysos, the god of wine.Scholars do not know precisely where Chalkidian pottery was made. Inscriptions on some vases have letters in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece, but no vases have been found there, or anywhere outside Italy and the western Mediterranean. The vases were probably made in a Chalkidian colony in southern Italy or in an immigrant workshop inEtruria.",

Figures fade into the darkbackground, while faces, hands, and even a knee emerge from the dimness. The figures are highly individualized, especially the old man at the right who holds his glasses firmly to his nose in order to see better and the elderly man with the weathered face and scraggly hair who holds his cape back against his shoulder.

During the American Civil War, one of the earliest wars to be extensively photographed, much of the Union Army's efforts was directed at rebuilding bridges and railroads destroyed by retreating Confederate forces. This experience working on railroad projects was a great aid to the nation in later years, when countless well-trained Civil War veterans worked on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and former General in the Union Army, remarked favorably upon the abilities of former soldiers who undertook backbreaking railroad work: \"It was the war that taught them how to think big, how to organize grand projects, how to persevere.\"",

Hanging clothes soften this stark industrial world, and the woman's closed eyes and thoughtful expression set a contemplative mood.Teske photographed the landscape in 1940 in a steel industry shantytown on the outskirts of Chicago. The image is sandwiched with a 1956 negative portraying Shirley Berman, the wife of Wallace Berman, a Beat movement artist and poet. Both were friends of Teske in Los Angeles; he often used Shirley's portrait in composite pictures as an archetypal female figure.For Teske, printing old negatives had a nostalgic and symbolic function. The composite photograph created a timeless, if not idealized, world that would otherwise be out of reach with a more conventional photographic approach. This composite image hints at a psychological state: the realm of the imagination.",

This view establishes an unobstructed line of sight to a point in the far distance, making the viaduct seem infinite. The shadowy sweep of the bridge overhead fans out of the frame like a lopsided crown, while a puddle of water just in front of the left pedestrian passageway, whose arch bears the stains of seeping water, suggests a more mundane problem threatening the impressive structure.",

To the left is theomphalos,the most sacred object at Delphi, regarded as the center of the earth. Aplinthon the right bears an inscription describing Apollo's conquest of Delphi with the Cretans, who became his first priests.The prophetess went to the tripod on the sacred seventh day of each month, the day of Apollo's birth, nine months of the year, to await the god's inspiration; her inspired utterances were later interpreted by a priest. The ancient Greeks considered the Delphic oracle--both Apollo's divine prophecy and the prophetess through whom it was spoken--the final authority on almost any matter, whether religious, political, or social.Camillo Miola merged academic andclassicaltraditions to construct his view of the classical past.

The herm reproduces the head of a lost Greek bronze portrait statue by Kephisodotos the Younger and Timarchos, the sons of the artist Praxiteles. The Roman writerPausaniasmentions the original Greek bronze statue, which was set up in theTheater of Dionysosin Athens shortly after Menander's death.The middle-aged man shown in this portrait is known from several other versions of the statue, and the occasional example inscribed with his name confirms the identification of all of these versions as Menander. His plays enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the Roman period, creating a demand for portraits of him.Beginning in the 500s B.C., Greeks placedherms, pillars surmounted by a head of the godHermes, at physical boundaries, such as crossroads or even doorways. Such places were sites of ritual and worship where the herms served a magical, protective function. The Romans later adapted the Greek concept of the herm, using it for non-religious, decorative purposes. The heads on Roman herms are often portraits of famous people.",

Holding this exaggerated pose, his back sways and his stomach pushes forward; his entire body presses up close to the surface of the picture.Ducreux was interested in the study of physiognomy and frequently used his own features as a convenient means to observe various expressions. In fact, he executed dozens of similarly exaggerated self-portraits throughout his career. A contemporary critic admired this self-portrait for its warmth, color, and expression, but later critics complained about the repetition of the subject.",

Faint shadows extend out from either foot, as well as from the small winged putto holding an empty escutcheon in the left corner, giving both figures an impression of depth.Scholars guess that the monk may be San Diego de Henares de Alcal\u00e0, a Spanish lay brother of the Capuchin order who died in 1463. San Diego was sent with missionaries to the Canary Islands and was canonized by Philip II of Spain. The king prayed to him when his son lay dying and, out of gratitude for the boy's recovery, asked the pope to make him a saint. Artists often drew San Diego carrying a cross or with the infant Jesus Christ in his arms.",

Absorbed in his devotions, he is unaware of three young women sneaking inside to steal flowers from a makeshift shrine. Above this trio, a woman on a ladder leans over a low wall and, with a long branch, taunts the praying hermit.Placed on the stone altar are a crucifix, books, an open Bible, an hourglass, a skull, and a rosary. The skull and hourglass, common symbols of the temporality of man and his creations, suggest that the building itself represents fallen greatness. Hubert Robert emphasizes the ruins' immensity by contrasting the small figures with the structure's massive columns. In the left foreground, a column shrouded in darkness runs nearly the full height of the composition. Birds roosting in the upper reaches of the lofty barrel vault reinforce the impression of the monument's vast dimensions.This small cabinet picture is one of several versions of the subject depicted by Robert beginning in the 1760s. In each of them, a monk prays beside a brick wall that has been built within the arcades of a Roman ruin. For this imaginary basilica, Robert likely drew inspiration from a contemporary print by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.",

This intimate bond, at its strongest during the period of Degas's photographic activity, is apparent in Hal\u00e9vy's casual comfort in his home and in front of the photographer. By January 1898 their friendship had become increasingly strained and then altogether severed because of Degas's anti-Semitism and opposing political views.",

The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers. The widely admired Brueghel the Younger depicted the senses, the elements, or the seasons as allegories many times throughout his career, either together or individually, as in the pendant to this painting,Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth).",

Instead he produced an entirely new type of pastoral subject: a young mother seated on the ground nursing her children. She is noticeably at home amidst the animals and the surrounding landscape. A classically posed male figure, presumably the father, casually leans on his horse, looking toward his family. The lazy-looking dog to the left of the composition is a stock figure that appears in some of the artist's other drawings. Castiglione conceived of this unusually large drawing as an independent work of art, and employed his characteristic, vigorous brushstrokes to convey a sense of vitality.",

In the early 1600s, Hendrik Avercamp continued and enlivened the tradition, packing his paintings with incidental detail and brightly colored costumes.

Even though it seems to be hanging rather than worn by a model, the way the two sides lift up evokes the gesture of a woman gathering her skirts. Scholars guess that, in place of a living model, Hans Brosamer often drew from actual articles of clothing that he arranged to suggest wearing or motion.Brosamer's practice of life drawing and his use of contemporary clothing as subject matter show that he was abreast of the artistic trends of his own period. At the same time, his tendency to treat the individual pieces of drapery as self-contained outlined forms illustrates his delight in examining the complex folds of cloth alone. In a closely hatched style, Brosamer enumerated not only the intricate patterns of the folds but also smaller details such as the skirt's vertical seam.",

He emphasized certain elements, subordinated others, and gave each landscape both unity and a poetic effect. Here he drew the trees with quick, thin strokes of the quill pen, suggesting their forms rather than specifically describing them. To emphasize the bulk of the tree at the left, he drew it darker and scratched through the paper's brown-tinted surface to create the white highlights.About ten years earlier, Rembrandt had begun drawing many landscapes. He roamed the area around Amsterdam, creating drawings and etchings that captured the Dutch countryside and its light and atmosphere, always with an economy of technique. As in this informal drawing, his landscapes express spontaneity and freshness while appearing like complete representations of the scenes he observed.",

        "description":"That Nadar was able to persuade theRomanticpoet Madame Desbordes-Valmore to sit for him at the very beginning of his career as a photographer had much to do with the reputation he had earlier gained as acaricaturistof literary and artistic circles. Her career, to which she had been late in coming, was nearly over. Although her name is now obscure, she was a well-known poet in her day, highly praised by her peers.When Nadar photographed her, Desbordes-Valmore was sixty-eight. She came to the studio somewhat reluctantly, citing her age and \"the cruelty of the sun.\" The resigned sadness of her weathered face bespoke not only climate but also the difficulties of her eventful life and the deaths of her brother, two sisters, two daughters, and most of her closest friends in recent years. Nadar focused the camera so carefully on her face and figure that the chair on which she sat and its shadow on the wall receded into the distance together. Nadar later photographed her a final time, on her deathbed in 1859. This is the only known print of this image.",

Some consult the Torah at the same time, passing it between them; other men in turbaned headdresses gaze up as Christ gestures towards heaven. In the background, an attentive crowd sits underneath the arches and columns of the classical synagogue.Guercino used brown ink energetically, describing the men's bodies swathed in long robes with quick, swirling pen strokes. The frenzied lines that surround Christ's upraised arm seem to suggest motion and his connection to his father above. Guercino used a top layer of brown wash to form hair, caps, beards, and shadows with broad, dark strokes.One of Guercino's followers used this drawing and two others as the basis of a painting of the same subject for the church of San Francesco in Ferrara.",

In a busy architecture study such as this one, the lone, winter-bare tree dominates the composition, its branches drawn carefully on the blank slate of sky.

The goddess Athena stands in front of the board and gestures. The warriors have their armor and weapons ready, as if just pausing during a break in the conflict. This scene of Ajax and Achilles gaming was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Many scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase. These hoplites may be Greeks on the march to counter a Trojan attack, while Ajax and Achilles are notified by Athena. Such an interpretation would explainAthena'sunusually prominent position on this rendition of the scene.",

The tender assistance of the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist draws attention to Jesus' wounds, stimulating the viewer's meditation on his sacrifice. His wounds are graphically rendered as open gashes dripping with blood. The saturated primary colors of the frame and draperies further set off Jesus' pale, emaciated body. Behind the figures, the pink cross picks up the faint, glowing hues of his suffering body. The full-page Lamentation appears within a sequence of images retelling the Passion story in this book of hours, the most popular type of private devotional manuscript of the later Middle Ages. The miniature of the Virgin and John mourning over the body of Jesus was particularly appropriate to a culture interested in devotional practices. Inspired by a burgeoning literature describing his torments, pious individuals increasingly focused their meditations on Jesus' suffering.",

To achieve this efficiency, rails had to be level, so engineers built bridges, trestles, and tunnels to facilitate an even path. William Henry Jackson made this photograph standing in one such engineering achievement--a tunnel for the Colorado Midland Railway. He positioned his camera so that the craggy mouth of the tunnel created a natural frame for a well-dressed group of passengers assembled on and around a train's caboose, with the mountains beyond. This photograph would have been an excellent advertisement, illustrating the ease of passengers, and the beauty of the scenery.",

        "description":"A young woman with long, curly hair wrestles open the jaws of a lion. The play of light and shadow across her belted dress emphasizes the rounded curves of her body, while Giovanni Bellini's simple yet powerful portrayal of her wrestling grip emphasized his skill with contrasts. He drew the woman's delicate curls with circular strokes, subtly different from the looser, curving lines of the lion's mane. Bellini displayed a confident and assured touch unusual for such a small-scale work.The woman represents Fortitude, one of the four Cardinal Virtues, a symbol of endurance and strength in mythology. She is more usually shown as a warrior, wearing a helmet and holding a shield, spear, or sword. Scholars do not know the purpose of this drawing, but because of its small size, it was likely made for a miniature or manuscript illumination.",

        "description":"Using red chalk in a highly detailed manner, Federico Zuccaro depicted Saint Peter's Square in Rome as it appeared in 1603, with the Egyptian obelisk in place at the extreme left and the church dome complete. At the left, the archepiscopal palace adjoins the old facade of Saint Peter's basilica. In the center, the three-story benediction loggia begun by Pope Pius II in 1462 adjoins the loggia painted by Raphael, lightly sketched at the extreme right. The bastion for the papal guard protects the front of the Vatican entrance, and statues of saints Peter and Paul from the 1400s adorn the foot of the staircase.On the verso, Zuccaro drew a young boy with great intimacy, using the same medium--black and red chalk--and the same delicacy of touch seen in his other late portrait studies. Zuccaro's use of color was innovative: scholars recognize him as the first Italian of his time to combine black with red chalk, a technique practiced earlier by Hans Holbein.",

        "description":"This cabinet was one of a pair delivered in 1788 for the bedroom of Louis XVI at the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Cloud. From a memoir written in the same year giving a detailed description of both cabinets, scholars know that both were originally veneered with panels of Japanese lacquer cut from a screen. The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques. The companion piece, now in the Royal Palace in Madrid, has been changed too; marquetry panels showing harbor scenes replaced the original lacquer.The mounts were cast by \u00c9tienne-Jean Forestier and Denis Bardin. They were chased by Pierre-Philippe Thomire and gilt by Claude Galle.",

        "description":"They are not just men running in a landscape; they are fugitive also--either running away from something or running to something.--Elisabeth FrinkCaptured mid-stride, this tall, lithe figure pushes forward toward an unknown destination. His wiry limbs highlight his athleticism and potential for speed, but also convey fragility. His nakedness, as well as the sculpture's pocked surface, reinforces this vulnerability. A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.  In addition to producing many male busts, Frink created imposing, essentially anonymous men in a variety of poses or guises--standing, seated, spinning, winged, and on horseback. She began a series of running men in the mid-1970s. In this series, Frink explores and exploits the tension between strength and vulnerability, feeling and suffering.",

The semi-circular arrangement of the other figures draws the viewer's eye around the scene and up through the trees to the putti in the air.

A few zigzagging stokes were all he needed to suggest the fabric of his cape and muscular legs.Franciabigio probably made the drawing from life, sketching a fellow artist or workshop assistant as he worked. The man wears clothing that was popular in the 1500s: a short doublet with a high stand-up collar, a short cloak, a codpiece, and breeches and stockings sewn together at the knee.

        "description":"Having undertaken the task of seeking and explaining beauty in modernity, Monsieur G., enjoys depicting women in all their finery, their beauty enhanced by every kind of artifice...--Charles Baudelaire,The Painter of Modern Life, c.1860A fashionably dressed woman promenades through one of Paris' many parks. Protecting herself from the sun, she holds a small blue parasol and wears a bonnet. Touches of white--her gloves, sleeves, and flowing scarf--offset her blue and purple ensemble. Between her billowy sleeves and her gloves, the woman displays golden jewelry. She demurely reaches down with her left hand to hold up her voluminous dress. This mass of material contrasts sharply with her small head and single foot peaking out from below.The woman's immense dress would have been supported by an elaborate structure of crinolines or stiffened petticoats. Constantin Guys produced this drawing at the height of fashion for crinolines and full skirts. To suggest many layers of thin fabric, Guys built up layer upon layer of wash and repeating triangles drawn in ink. Guys' attention to contemporary fashion and make-up made him Charles Baudelaire's quintessential painter of modern life. But Baudelaire championed \"Monsieur G\" not merely for conveying appearances and artifice. For Baudelaire, Guys' watercolors and drawings not only captured his subjects in the present moment, but also imbued them with a look of timelessness, elevating them to the status of historical figures.",

In this manuscript's text andminiatures, Alexander is presented as a complex figure, a man capable of bravery and good judgment but also subject to human foibles. Both the positive and negative lessons of Alexander's story were considered valuable for a Renaissance prince and military leader such asCharles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, to whom Vasco dedicated his text.The Getty Museum's copy of this widely diffused text, a large and lavishlyilluminated manuscriptwith fourteen miniatures, was probably made for an aristocrat associated with the Burgundian court, someone who would have particularly appreciated the manuscript's scenes of battle and court intrigue.

Growing out of his association with the Hospitallers, Anthony was called on to prevent and cure disease in both people and animals, which explains the assortment of followers around him.The miniature was painted by the anonymous artist known as the Master of Saint Veronica in the International style, which is characterized by bright jewel-like colors, detailed elaborate costumes, linearity, and melancholic expressions. The animals' naturalism demonstrates the artist's interest in the careful observation of nature.",

        "description":"The Vexed Manis one of a series of 69 portrait busts or \"character heads\" made by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, an eighteenth-century German sculptor active in Austria. Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia. A contemporary wrote that Messerschmidt told him that by making the character heads, he hoped to ward away spirits that invaded his mind.",

Other painters and draftsmen had produced formal portraits of this important figure, but none captured de Silvestre as frankly and naturally as in this preparation for a more elaborate pastel, now in the collection of the Musee Antoine-L\u00e9cuyer, St. Quentin, France.De Silvestre appears in an unguarded moment without his wig. The scarf tied around his head suggests he is working in his studio. La Tour candidly recorded his 73-year-old subject's blood vessels, wrinkles, and moles, giving De Silvestre realistic human qualities that formal portraiture of the period did not often capture. He and La Tour were friends, which also contributes to the intimacy of the portrait. Made seven years before de Silvestre's death, this drawing strikingly conveys the physical effects of age.",

He twisted the bodies and omitted the right forearm, adjusting the poses to fit all the views on one sheet and to create a pleasingcomposition. Characteristically, he sketched in some of the feet without much detail and gave only the most summary treatment to the heads.

        "description":"Silhouetted against rolling, stormy, clouds, a gray, spotted horse stands, turning its head slightly to suggest its alertness to its surroundings. Paulus Potter, the finest Dutch animal painter of his day, described the horse with scrupulous attention to physical detail: the glossy sheen of its coat and mane, the watery moistness of its eye, and the sleekly elegant lines of the animal's body. At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free. His immaculate grooming and position before cultivated fields, however, imply that the source of Dutch prosperity lay in the control that humans were able to exert over brute nature.",

        "description":"A profusion of animals fills the earth and sky. Fighting, playing, climbing, flying, and swimming, they are shepherded byNoahtoward the ark in the far distance. All species of animals are portrayed, from large lumbering elephants to tiny turtles and hamsters in theforeground. Bats and birds soar across the sky, receding into thebackgroundwhere brighter skies hold promise of a future.The story of Noah's ark provided a subject well suited to Jan Brueghel the Elder's descriptive abilities. Overcome by the wickedness of the human race, God resolved to cleanse the earth with a great flood. He spared only the lives of the family of Noah, the sole just man. God instructed Noah to build an ark and to take on board a male and a female of every species of bird and beast.In 1609 Brueghel was appointedcourt paintertoArchduke Albertand theInfanta Isabella, who had collected exotic and unusual animals from across the world, creating a menagerie in Brussels. Brueghel studied and drew many of these animals from life. With the discovery of the New World in the 1600s came an increased curiosity about natural history. This interest led many European rulers, who had in the past collected stuffed animals, shells, and other natural objects, to form menageries of rare live animals.",

        "description":"The subject of thisbust, sprouting from a cluster of palm leaves, looks out with an expression revealing the intelligence, compassion, and strength for which she became known inVictorianEngland. An extraordinary Jamaican woman, Mary Seacole traveled extensively in Central and South America, where she learned to treat yellow fever and cholera. During the Crimean War, she followed the troops as a sutler, one of the many people offering hospitality services and running inns, bars, and restaurants. In the Ukraine, in addition to running a hotel, she supplied medical services to British troops on the front line, remaining even longer than her fellow nurse Florence Nightingale. After the war, Seacole published her autobiography,The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands,which became a huge popular and commercial success. By the time Henry Weekes executed this bust in 1859, she was a household name in England.  Emphasizing her innate nobility, Weekes used a simple oval form for the chest, adorning the mature woman with only a necklace and the hoop earrings that she always wore. The unusual socle covered with palm leaves refers to Seacole's Jamaican origins, considered tropical and exotic by the English.",

Although the young sitter's identity is unknown, he is presumed to be a member of the French royal family.Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re positioned his figure before an atmospheric landscape and used fluent brushwork, rich autumnal colors, and exquisite treatment of draperies. All these characteristics betray his training in aFlemishlateBaroquestyle heavily indebted to Anthony van Dyck.The inclusion of elaborate symbolism also reflects a Baroque sensibility. The child's costume refers to nobility, his pet dog to fidelity, and the thornbush to the Crown of Thorns. Through an extended series of connections, the goldfinch functions as a symbol of the Passion: goldfinches eat seeds from the thorny thistle, another reminder of the Crown of Thorns, and the red spot on their breast is a further reminder of Christ's bloody death.",

An array of colors--citron, lavender, turquoise, and rose--fills the sky as the sun slowly sets. Light reflects against the trees, turning the edges and foliage yellow-orange; the pool of water shimmers with reflections. The dramatically colored backlighting and the tiny, lone man create a sense of melancholy and longing that appealed to the Romantic critics of the time.Composing from memories and from drawings made during his travels in Italy, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot painted this view for the Paris Salon of 1839. It may be a pendant toItalian Landscape, which he painted the same year. Until they were offered to the Getty Museum in 1984, scholars thought both paintings were lost.

He sits quietly, looking directly into the camera and holding what appears to be a closed daguerreotype case in his hands.Daguerreotypes were very delicate and the image could be scratched rather easily, so they were frequently mounted behind a glass and mat in a velvet-lined case. The Langenheims may have used this accomplished portrait in their studio window display to entice potential customers. The embossed word \"Exchange\" on the case lining indicates the street where their Philadelphia studios were located.",

A single candle lights the vaulted interior, illuminating the arches and the square tiles of the stone floor. Another flame glimmers weakly, visible through a darkened archway in the background and casting a small glow over a staircase. Hendrick van Steenwijck employed these contrasts of light and darkness to play with the viewer's sense of perspective. Using strongchiaroscuro,he guided the viewer's eye around the scene, from the brilliant glow of the column and ceiling in the middle, back through the arch to the stairs, and finally to the dark interior beyond.Various gradations of light also emphasize the room's tones and textures. Candlelight shows off the joins in the masonry, as well as the cracks in the ceiling, the wood panels in the door, and the gleaming folds of the guard's cloak.",

As the story was recounted inHomer'sIliad, Odysseus and Diomedes infiltrated the Thracian camp outside the walls of Troy, hoping to steal their fine horses. This vase is the only depiction of the murder of Rhesos in theArchaicperiod; it is remarkably close to Homer's account, down to the display of armor and the Thracian horses who panic on their tethers under the handles of the vase.When the Greeks began founding colonies in Italy and Sicily in the 600s B.C., they initially imported fine decorated pottery. Soon, however, local pottery workshops arose. Chalkidian pottery, one of these local productions in theblack-figure technique, was probably made in the city of Rhegion, a colony of the Greek city of Chalkis.",

The numerous gestures that revealed an individual's class and work fascinated Degas, and he focused on the laundresses' expressive faces and bodies. One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing. Reyer's intense gaze contrasts sharply with the studied indifference of the object of his attention.At the top of this page, Degas set the stage for the scene: \"For a long time, Reyer has been offering a third-floor box [the cheapest theater box] to a washerwoman.\" On the right Reyer sheepishly offers a piece of paper to a washerwoman, who holds an iron close to her cheek in order to judge its heat. There may be a sexual inference in Reyer's offer, especially since washerwomen in the 1800s often turned to prostitution to supplement their low incomes.",

He also showed the effects of shadows on the top and right parts of the altar frame and noted the size of various components on the design so that this large altar could be built with precision.Although this drawing does not relate to any known structure, it probably represents an unexecuted design for a side altar for the cathedral of Siena.

Simon Bening contrasted Pilate's imperious stance, hand on hip and staff of office raised, with Joseph's posture of humility. Pilate stands beneath the arch of an imposing stone facade reaching up to the miniature's top frame, while a serene town, the open blue sky visible above, serves as a backdrop for Joseph and his companions. Bening thus divided theilluminationinto two halves, using body language and setting to increase the viewer's compassion for Joseph's cause.",

He brazenly closed in on this stranger, whose weary face is framed in an abundant fur collar. Evans's goal was to record a glimpse of random faces against the chaos of crowds, automobiles, and mass transit. In this view, the entrance to the elevated train dominates the right edge of the picture.",

Manuel Alvarez Bravo photographed this scene from a low vantage point to illustrate the multiple layers of crosses at work.

Death, therefore, becomes an intricate part of everyday life. Perhaps these decorations were left over from the rituals ofD\u00eda de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, when people visit the cemetery to honor their deceased relatives.",

A handful of rough looking men gather to play backgammon, while others sit around, immensely enjoying their smoking tobacco. Men, women, and even children drink beer. Couples fondle one another in the more secluded spaces of a corner or balcony.Cornelis Dusart underscored his subjects' lewd behavior through suggestive details: rustic wooden furniture and earthenware jugs; food, pipes, and playing cards scattered about; patrons' ragged clothes and missing teeth. He used a sharpened piece of hard black chalk to draw on the smooth vellum and gray ink to define shadow areas; media that provide a light but fine rendering.The type of iconography depicted in this drawing was central to a genre of Dutch art in which everyday people are engaged in common activities. Drawings were often framed and hung, or simply pinned up, on the walls of middle-class homes. This large-scale drawing served as a finished work of art, but Dusart also made a painting of the same scene.",

After the ch\u00e2teau that had occupied these grounds burned in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, the gardens were all that survived.The absence of children or other pedestrians leisurely enjoying the park imparts a sense of solitude and loneliness to the image. Atget intended that his photographs be used as source material for artists of all mediums. This empty park would have provided a simple background, like a stage set, for an artist to copy and then enliven with the addition of figures.",

Yet, because each of the boys tucks his nearer arm in toward his body, the composition remains open. The goldfinch held carelessly in the Christ Child's left hand symbolizes his future Crucifixion.This painting's small scale and sensitive, poetic intimacy contrast with Giovanni Lanfranco's more usual grand, illusionistic decorations. The painting's frame, a type that was often used in the Barberini Palace in Rome, hints at the picture's previous location. Lanfranco may have painted it for a private chapel owned by the Barberini, Pope Urban VIII's family and leading patrons of Baroque art in Rome in the 1600s.",

        "description":"A youth leans over to adjust the heel strap of his sandal, supporting himself on a staff. The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.",

        "description":"To emphasize the frenzied violence of the mocking of Christ, Niklaus Manuel Deutsch devised a dynamic radial composition with Christ's luminous, haloed head as the focal point of attacks from all sides. He also included a framing line, to which he wittily called attention by extending the soldier's foot outside its bounds at the bottom.Northern European artists frequently made drawings on colored grounds to be sold to collectors as independent works of art. Manuel Deutsch and such contemporaries as Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Albrecht Aldorfer employed the technique of drawing on a deeply colored ground with white strokes delineating contours or modeling figures. Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink. Next he brushed in the lavish whiteheightening, refined additional details in black ink, and touched in Christ's halo with gold pigment.",

The father's large size, powerful musculature, and wild hair and beard contrast with his smaller, smoother-limbed sons. As retold in Greek mythology, the Trojan prince Laoco\u00f6n angered Apollo by breaking a vow of celibacy he swore to the god and then warning the Trojans not to bring the wooden horse left by the Greeks into the city. To silence him, Apollo sent serpents from the sea to kill him and his sons.Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze of this story is based on a famous marble sculpture of the Laoco\u00f6n unearthed in Rome in 1506. The Roman historian Pliny had described this renowned sculpture in awed language, as \"a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced.\" Its celebrity prompted many bronze reductions, or smaller-scale copies including this one, made in Florence. Although it imitates an antique work, the emotionalism and frontality of this bronze are characteristics of the late Baroque Florentine style.This type of tabletop bronze was often displayed on a cabinet where it served as a souvenir of the \"Grand Tour,\" evidence of its owner's classical education.",

These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription \"from the games at Athens.\" The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism is applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. An additional inscription, seen here to the right of Athena, names the archon or city magistrate. Because historical records date these magistrates, the vase can be dated very precisely.

Photographers sought to capture that energy and spirit by focusing on the architectural activity that was daily transforming the New York skyline and setting a precedent for the rest of the world to emulate. In this view, Walker Evans eliminated any reference to sky or horizon by pointing his camera down upon the towering structures, suggesting that he occupied an even loftier perch in some even higher building.",

My self critique led me to conclude that I was protesting against something in these pictures...I had judged the \"official\"Bauhaustone-setters...guilty of taking themselves too damned seriously, and that they needed \"taking down.\"Thus T. Lux Feininger recalled the mood informing his picturemaking during his time as a student at the German crafts school, the Bauhaus. This playful photograph shows three unidentified members of the Bauhaus band with their instruments humorously juxtaposed and a ladder that neither leans on any wall nor leads anywhere. The smiling man at the center, wearing a bow tie and bellboy's cap, strums the banjo held by the grinning man at the right, who in turn appears to singlehandedly support the ladder upon which a third man plays the slide trombone in a dramatic, downward thrust parallel to the lines of the ladder. Influenced by the Jazz Age, both players and photographers evoke the lively spirit of that revolutionary movement in music.",

In this image, Urban VI sits at the right, and Clement VII sits at the left, flanked by his supporters. King Charles V of France, who accepted the validity of Clement's election, stands at the far left wearing robes bearing fleurs-de-lis, the French royal insignia.

The woman's pose, taken from representations of the penitent saint Mary Magdalene, the reformed New Testament courtesan traditionally depicted with long, flowing hair, further emphasizes the drawing's light, satirical tone.Fragonard's light, fluent washes also work to convey a sense of abandonment, evident especially in the wildly tossed-about bedclothes. These fluid passages contrast with the arresting precision of the woman's eye, nostril, and mouth, captured in small marks made with the point of the brush.In the later 1760s, Fragonard created a number of drawings devoted to erotic themes.

They were designed for the laity and were frequently tailored to a patron's individual interests.Jean Bourdichon,court painterto four successive French kings, illuminated this book of hours, which represents some of his earliest work. He produced gloriousminiatureswith sophisticated landscapes, dramatic lighting, and monumental figures. Illuminations in books of hours, usually placed at the beginnings of the individual prayers, provided a visual focus, aiding the reader in his or her meditations.The intertwined initialsIandKappear frequently in the borders of themanuscript, with theIembraced by a loop that forms the arms of theK.

The son of aFrench revolutionarygeneral and a black mother, Dumas arrived in Paris from the provinces in 1823, poor and barely educated. Working as a clerk, he educated himself in French history and began to write. In 1829 he met with his first success; with credits includingThe Three MusketeersandThe Count of Monte Cristo, published in 1844 and 1845, respectively, his fame and popularity were assured.Nadar was the first photographer to use photography to enhance the sitter's reputation. Given Dumas's popularity, this mounted edition print, signed and dedicated by him, was likely intended for sale.Dumas is represented as a lively, vibrant man. The self-restraint of his crossed hands, resting on a chair that disappears into the shadows, seems like an attempt to contain an undercurrent of boundless energy that threatened to ruin the necessary stillness of the pose and appears to have found an outlet through Dumas's hair.

        "description":"Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.",

The manuscript's illumination primarily takes the form of historiated initials marking each of the major holidays of the church year. The illuminator of this manuscript, known as the Master of Gerona, worked in Italy in the late 1200s. Familiar with the most recent trends in Italian panel painting and Byzantine icon painting, he knew how to convey a sense of weight, volume, and depth. Drawing on these innovations, he embedded scenes of surprising naturalism within the initials.",

Within the scene's frozen motion, Hippolytos's dramatic yet rigid pose typifies theNeoclassicalstyle. Nevertheless the artist emphasized his technical skill by contrasting the varied soft textures of the frothy clouds of sea spray, the horses' swirling manes and tails, and the leopard skin tied around Hippolytos's waist.Hippolytos's stepmother Phaidra fell in love with him, but he rejected her affections. In revenge, she left a note accusing him of defiling her, and committed suicide. His enraged fatherTheseusbanished Hippolytos and begged the gods to destroy him. As a result, the sight of a sea monster frightened the horses pulling Hippolytos in his chariot. Hippolytos lost control, and the horses dragged the hero to his death. Carle Vernet exhibited this drawing and itspendant,The Return from the Race,at theSalonof 1800, where they received wide acclaim. So popular were the scenes that another artist then produced engravings after them, which were exhibited at the Salon of 1808.

        "description":"Known in her younger days as the \"sirenwith green eyes,\" Madame Nadine Dumas retains her grace and charm in this portraitbustof her at a mature age. Carved in white marble, she is a handsome woman in her later years with a forceful presence. As she turns with a steady gaze, her upright pose conveys self-assurance. Her unconventional expression suggests intelligence and strength as it shows her with a furrowed brow, caught in a moment of thought. The lace edging on her blouse and the waves in her upswept hair add animation to the smooth surface, while the termination of the bust is softened with a shawl loosely knotted around the shoulders and waist.The daughter of a lawyer from the Baltic region, Nadine, born Nadeja Knorring, married Prince Alexandre Naryschkine, her elder by twenty years. After separating from her husband, she lived with the famous author Alexandre Dumasfilsfor about twelve years, unable to marry him until 1864, when Prince Naryschkine died. Artist Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, a close friend of Dumas and a witness at his wedding to Nadeja, conceived of the bust as a friendship portrait. He carved it while staying with the Dumas couple in the north of France near Dieppe.",

        "description":"After 1850, France's railroads expanded rapidly under private ownership and with the encouragement ofNapoleon III. Both the government and private owners of railroads commissioned photographs to attract new investors to the transportation system; theChemin de Fer du Bourbonnais(Bourbonnais Railway Company) assigned Hippolyte-Auguste Collard to make this photograph, an interior view of a roundhouse, a building for servicing and housing locomotives. Roundhouses were less efficient than rectangular buildings because of their single rotating center slab that moved the locomotives into their berths. But that fact would never be deduced from this gleaming, orderly interior, a model of efficiency.Each identical engine aligns perfectly with the hood that draws the steam from the pipe, thus keeping the building clear of poisonous carbon monoxide fumes. Using awide-angle lens, Collard has photographed the scene to maximize the room's spatial configuration, and in doing so he has flattened theperspective. The engines appear to be miniatures: only the door visible at the lower center edge between two engines gives an indication of the interior's actual scale and the technical feat that Collard achieved in rendering such a sweeping view.",

Long admired as an exceptional draftsman, Tiepolo used rapid strokes of ink and dark, fluid washes to evoke the flat terrain and bright sunlight of the Veneto, the region of Italy around Venice.Instead of architectural accuracy or detail, Tiepolo explored light, tone, and texture. Clouds cast shadows on the sunlit building, and even the golden brown shadows on the stone outer wall are suffused with light, but the exact building cannot be identified. To render the quickly sketched large tree, which acts as a foil for the greatmassof this typically Venetian villa, Tiepolo adopted Guercino's dynamicchiaroscuroeffects.",

He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space. Masterfully handling a difficult medium, van Gogh revealed the luminosity of watercolor and hinted at the expressiveness and colorful palette of his art to come.",

Philip was a highly successful political leader of his day as well as an important and influential patron of manuscript illumination. The witty scene illustrates a noblewoman's endeavor to deal with her husband's Christian mistress. In the chapel at right, the wife of the adulterous knight prays for the Virgin Mary to avenge her by punishing the mistress. However, Mary refuses the request on account of the adulteress's deep devotion to her. Subsequently when wife and mistress encounter one another in the street the mistress is so embarrassed--she falls to her knees--she promises to give up the husband. Meanwhile the wayward husband cowers behind the chapel. Given the duke's own serial philandering--he fathered several dozen children outside his marriage and relatively few within it--one cannot help but wonder how he responded to this moralizing tale.The miniature is painted entirely in grey tones, a technique called grisaille, popular in the later Middle Ages. Despite the lack of color, the illuminator, Lieven van Lathem, vividly evokes the buildings and cobblestone streets of a prosperous Netherlands town such as Ghent where van Lathem, the court painter of Philip the Good, resided.",

With one hand he points to a round, sculpturalreliefofApollo, the god of the arts. Made two years before his death, the drawing glorifies him as a great collector and man of letters.The formality of this carefully finished portrait suggests that it was meant to be engraved, though scholars know of no existing print. The painstaking physical detail, from the rich draperies to the detailing of the books, together with the subtle modulation of his rich garments all suggest translation into the printed medium.",

        "description":"Throughout his work, Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes expressed himself freely and often with humor. This page from his \"Album C\" seems, at first glance, to be one of his depictions of working girls. This young woman, however, wears a fine dress, jewelry, and a rather coy hairstyle and displays a graceful, almost cultivated bearing. She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding. At least seventy years old when he made this drawing, Goya remained fluid and spontaneous in his technique, quickly capturing the swaying of her skirt and the little crinkles in her sleeve.",

Drawing late in his life, Richardson focused on his face, with its firm mouth, dimpled chin, and pouchy eyes, rather than his clothing. The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the gleaming tip of his nose, the edges of his lips, and his scarf highlighted in white. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of deep shadows cast by the tilt of the turban, headgear popular with artistic types in the 1700s.",

A deep purple mantle wraps around her back and falls across her smooth arms.

This compilation is called theHistorical Biblebecause the commentaries stressed the role ofscriptureas a record of historical events. Thus, in most illuminated copies, the book ofGenesis, the first of the historical books of the Bible, is profusely illustrated, while non-historical books, like those of the prophets, receive only oneilluminationeach.

The palm of the artist's hand faces out, with extra fingers added to denote the sea creature's eight limbs. Puckered lips, sometimes with tongue and\/or gums showing, represent suction-cup like suckers typically associated with an octopus' anatomy. They radiate from a central point on the mollusk's underbelly, growing or shrinking in size to suggest shape and movement.

        "description":"A drunken peasant tries to steady himself, awkwardly twisting his body and staring down at nothing in particular. He appears unaware of the precarious position of the earthenware pitcher in his left hand. The peasant's intemperate state showcases Cornelis Dusart's ability to capture the human form in an unusual pose, as well as his delicate modeling of the sitter's rumpled clothes and ruddy features.Continuing the genre tradition established by his teacher Adriaen van Ostade, Dusart specialized in depictions of peasant life. Like Van Ostade, Dusart produced studies exploring variations in pose and expression of single, seated figures. But the use of red chalk--often highlighting hands and face--was Dusart's own innovation.",

        "description":"The beauty of the Icelandic landscape is not limited to volcanic phenomena, the mountains of igneous rock, the torrential rivers and thunderous falls, or the ice-filled glacial lakes; its vegetation is also a major attraction. The trees are dwarfed and stunted. Tundra covers much of the interior; arctic and alpine wildflowers bloom in seemingly unlimited abundance in summer. But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed. Iceland's luxurious mosses, which blanket the region instead of forests, first drew Porter to visit the island in 1972. This photograph displays their startling range of colors and textures. Rocks rounded and smoothed by river water are draped with splotches of rust, yellow, gold, and green.In 1972, the Sierra Club published Iceland, a portfolio of twelve dye transfer prints in an edition of 110. Porter also wanted to publish a book on the subject, but he could not find a publisher.  Undaunted, Porter persisted and seventeen years later, it was published. The book contains an essay by Porter's son Jonathan, who often traveled with him. In the foreword, Jonathan wrote: \"Iceland possesses a primordial quality, as if one were a time traveler viewing an earlier formative age of the earth.\" Porter's close-up views, like this one, convey that uniqueness.",

        "description":"In search of the \"genuine peasant\" type for this genre scene of domestic rural life, Henry Peach Robinson described how he first envisioned this image:One of the best models I ever employed was an old man of seventy-four. He was a crossing-sweeper. I should never have accomplished one of my best works if I had not seen him sitting at a table in my studio, waiting, till I could talk to him. I not only saw the old man there, but mentally, the old lady, and the interior of the cottage...The old man, by his attitude and expression, gave the germ of the idea; the old lady had to be found, and the cottage built, but they appeared to me then quite visibly and solidly.When Day's Work is Doneexists in more copies than any other photograph by Robinson. The photograph is acombination printmade from six different negatives, a significant technical accomplishment. The negatives were attached in pairs to a sheet of glass for support, and the final image was made in three printings of those pairs.The line between the light-colored wall behind the woman and the dark shadows of the room, a stage set built for the photograph, reveals one of the seams between negatives. This deceptively simple domestic scene required a complicated printing process to accommodate its range of illumination, from the darkforegroundto the bright outdoors seen through the window.",

But for the majority of passenger, railroad travel was incredibly uncomfortable in the 1800s.

The maenad, one of the female followers ofDionysos, the god of wine, reclines on a striped cushion. The wineskin in the background may explain her sound sleep. Filling the interior of this fragmentaryred-figurekylixor cup, this scene of an erotically charged encounter between the human and bestial companions of Dionysos was a particularly fitting decoration for a vessel used at asymposiumor drinking party. Sexual sparring between satyrs andmaenads, the one side pursuing and the other evading, was a favorite theme on symposium vessels. The image of the satyr creeping up on his helpless sleeping prey had a particular appeal. Each side of the exterior of the cup once displayed a figure of a dancing satyr shown in a complex pose. The best preserved of these satyrs is shown from the back; only the profile-view legs, tail, and drinking horn remain of the other.",

The young pupil follows the centaur's guidance and directs his weapon toward a target beyond the sheet's top right corner. The two figures hold relatively similar poses, conveying the emotional bond between them. The drawing also suggests movement and power: as the pair turn to the upper right, Chiron's horse-body hurtles diagonally through the center of the composition.In 1838, the forty-year old Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix received one of his most significant public commissions: the large curved ceiling of the Deputies' Library of the Palais Bourbon. Completed in 1847, Delacroix's decorative program illustrated the themes of Philosophy, Science, Poetry, Law, and Theology. Related to the theme of Poetry, this pencil drawing on tracing paper, is one of several in which Delacroix explored this dynamic composition. It was conceived to accommodate an unusually shaped section of the library's ceiling. Delacroix kept this work in his studio and returned to it more than twenty years later when he created a pastel of the same subject, also in the Getty's collection, as a gift for the writer Georges Sand.",

It is made up of two photographic prints that were hand cut and then layered, one upon the other, and mounted between sheets of Plexiglas. By slicing into the prints' surfaces, Soo Kim added a surreal quality to the skeletal outlines of this urban environment, in which traces of nature such as trees and water improbably poke through interior spaces.Intrigued by reports of Reykjav\u00edk's compact scale and rich folklore, Soo Kim traveled to Iceland's capital city in 2005. After exploring the pedestrian friendly city, she selected a rooftop vantage point that provided access to condensed views of the brightly painted homes lining narrow streets and sweeping vistas of the surrounding mountains and sea. Adjusting the focus of her handheld 2 1\/4-inch format camera, she rotated 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction to create a loosely structured panorama. Taken at midnight during the summer solstice, the photographs introduce elements of uncertainty into a city that appears brightly lit but eerily still.",

The color notes that he included also support the idea of a costume design, since the assistants in his workshop would have needed such notes to faithfully re-create his design in fabric. Several of his other costume designs include elaborately decorated helmets such as the one this centaur wears. Primaticcio probably depicted only one element in a larger composition celebrating the popular story of the neighboring tribes of the centaurs and the Lapiths. According to classical mythology, the Lapiths invited the centaurs to their king's wedding, but the centaurs responded by carrying off the Lapith women-even the bride-under the influence of wine. The battle that ensued ended with the centaurs' defeat and expulsion from the Lapiths' country.",

        "description":"Always captivated by gesture and motion, in the 1870s Edgar Degas became interested in ballet dancers and particularly in the youngest ballerinas of thecorps. During frequent visits to Paris's ballet school, he found what interested him most: movement--not free and spontaneous action but precise exercises. On this crowded sheet, one dancer practices at the bar in the upper left with her back toward the viewer, while two others with legs extended lean over on the right. It was the studied position of each girl's legs that fascinated the artist; he often did not even bother to finish the top half of the body. In the bottom right corner, he quickly sketched a group of four dancers, their heads together in deep discussion, with the observant head of the ballet master just visible behind them.Using quick, even careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures with abrupt lines as if he was impatient to record each woman's posture or hand movement in the most emphatic terms without sacrificing swiftness or spontaneity. He wasted no time to give depth to the forms with unnecessary shading or hatching; the finger he dragged over the tutu of the dancer at the top left created a smudgy shadow that simply suggests the garment's fabric.",

This sculpture is one of a pair of tabletop bronzes that show a wild beast brutally killing a domesticated animal. Although the pair are based onantiquemodels, the animal subject and intense emotionalism are characteristic of the late 1500s and early 1600s.In a play of space and movement, theManneristsculptor Giambologna arranged the figures' limbs in a circle. Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and\/or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture. In his biography of Giambologna, Filippo Baldinucci mentions the pair of animal bronzes, but they may have been cast after Giambologna's death as the Susini continued using his models for many years.",

Animated and dimensional, the striped sections are arranged in an optically disturbing alternating pattern, their placement suggesting wings.",

Lost in thought as her greyhound nuzzles her arm, she has dropped off her garment and seems spent from a long day of huntingSebatiano Ricci characteristically employed this graceful, elongated figure type and lively brushwork, but the mutedpalette, modest dimensions, and reflective tone are unusual for him. Perhaps he restrained his normally bold colors here because he depicted Diana at dusk. This painting shows his transition to a moreRococostyle ofpastelcolors and a lighter touch, leaving behind his earlier Baroque compositions with their dramatic gestures, bold colors, and serious subject matter.",

        "description":"Following his tour of duty as a Civil War photographer, Alexander Gardner headed west. Construction of a transcontinental railroad became a national priority after the destructive years of war, and Gardner followed its course. He photographed the Eastern Division of the Union Pacific Railroad as it stretched across Kansas from the Missouri River to its junction with the main line at Hays City, Kansas.Small figures punctuate the barely discernible flatbed cars that link the engine and caboose and span the entire length of the trestle bridge. They seem to merge with the bridge itself, transforming the train-and-bridge into a chain pulled taut across the hilly landscape. Additional tiny figures, including a lone man in the near distance who watches the photographer intently, pepper the ground below, as though cast off by the train.",

        "description":"Leaning back, Venus, goddess of love and beauty, gently twists her head to look at the small wreath she holds aloft in her left hand. Nude, her drapery falling down upon her legs, she rests on a rock amidst seashells. According to myth, Venus was born from the foam of the sea, an aspect of her legend suggested by the sculpture's title, Venus Marina. Although cupid or a dolphin usually accompanies Venus Marina, neither are present here.This tabletop bronze was made after a model attributed to the French sculptor Robert Le Lorrain. As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms. Other similar Venus figures attest to the popularity of this genre of sculpture in France in the early 1700s.",
